We are happy to announce that Crust and Robonomics have started collaborating to bring resilient data storage infrastructure to robotics and smart devices. This partnership means there will be much deeper integration between the Crust and Robonomics parachains on Kusama, as well as an interesting new approach for cross-chain collaboration to simplify the user experience.

There are two main objectives that we are looking to achieve together:

<robo-list>
    <robo-list-item>
        The resilient storage of data that comes from Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics devices. Currently, the Robonomics parachain uses IPFS both on our robotics controllers and centralized pinning services to make it persistent. Having access to Crust’s decentralized pinning service will offer users cryptographic proofs of storage in many redundant storage locations.
    </robo-list-item>
    <robo-list-item>
        Decentralized hosting of dApps. This is something that was not available before, and as a result, Robonomics dApps had to be hosted by traditional cloud providers or using owned hardware. With Crust, dApps can have decentralized hosting, which guarantees that services will remain available. The fact that developers can create services with no single point of failure, that will remain available for users globally, is extremely important for robotics and any physical world deployments in general.

Robonomics team has already started exploring Crust Network and has been impressed by the diligent approach to documentation. You can already launch a [Boston Dynamics robot in Bay Area lab](https://spot.merklebot.com) via a Robonomics parachain transaction, whilst the data will be recorded on Crust. Feel free to try it out for yourself on [spot.merklebot.com](https://spot.merklebot.com).

Now, we will focus on XCM integration between the Crust Shadow and Robonomics parachains. This will allow us to send transactions for storage directly from smart devices in a fully decentralized way. It should be noted that there is an interesting set of questions related to transaction fees when services are delivered by one parachain to another, which needs to be answered.

We believe that the user should only pay for a transaction within the parachain they were using. In our case, when a Robonomics parachain user wants to save the data from robotics and smart devices to the Crust Network - they will only have to pay for services in XRT.

The Robonomics parachain is working on deploying a special pallet that would be able to send a transaction to Crust Shadow with the requirement to save the data and pay from the Robonomics parachain account directly in CSM tokens.  The user will be charged some XRT to compensate for the storage cost automatically.

Eventually, parachains will automatically sell native tokens on a DEX to replenish the balance of other parachain tokens that offer additional services. It is mindblowing to realize that this fully decentralized and autonomous scenario is already realistic!

We are looking forward to an exciting future collaborating on truly decentralized solutions in the field of robotics, IoT and smart devices.
