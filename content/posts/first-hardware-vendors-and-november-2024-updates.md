## First Robonomics Hardware Vendors

The Robonomics team has spontaneously formed a network of four hardware vendors for cyberpunks. They will maintain small inventories of Robonomics devices in their local warehouses and offer hardware connected directly to Polkadot worldwide throughout 2025, regardless of the core team’s involvement!

**North and South America:** M2M Economy Ltd, San Francisco, USA.

**Europe:**  [ "Pinout"](https://pinout.cloud), Limassol, Cyprus.

**CIS:**  [ "Multi-Agent Systems"](http://multi-agent.io), St. Petersburg, Russia.

**Japan and Asia:** Akagi Engineering Co., Tokyo, Japan.

Companies in Japan and the USA will accept payments not only in local currency but also in cryptocurrency.

This week, each company will take our blueprints created by [Robonomics Hardware Department](https://x.com/RobonomicsHW) and order a small batch of PCBs for the first four devices. Local companies will handle 3D printing for enclosures and assembly. The Robonomics website will feature direct links to online stores where you can order and pay for your first-ever open hardware gadget connected to the Web3 cloud.

## Introducing the Energy Monitor

We have decided to replace the smart safe in our initial product lineup with a ready-to-use energy monitor.

The Robonomics Energy Monitor records electricity consumption and generation data in the Polkadot network at 10-minute intervals. Simply describe the digital twin of the object you wish to monitor and choose your network connection: Kusama (free) / Polkadot (paid)

For households and individuals looking to link energy generation data to carbon credit issuance, we offer integration with our [DAO_IPCI](https://x.com/DAO_IPCI) solution, which has already been used over 10 times for green finance use cases.
