Robonomics team greatly values the support from the community. We understand that the main problem which stands before you right now is the fear of ending up being contributors of a project that will not get a slot. No slot, no reward. As a result, the community supports the first and doubts to support those who are fighting for the 4th and 5th slots.

Of course, we could take a step back now and just wait for Autumn, when auctions for the next slots should start. Observing the current crowdfunding process, it is safe to say that Robonomics will get a Kusama parachain slot this year. Nonetheless, we would like to fight for the 4th and 5th slots. And that is why we are publishing plan B.

Plan B guarantees rewards for all of the 2021 crowdloan campaign participants and the launch of staking on the Robonomics frontier network. Which will last until we obtain a Kusama network slot. This is an excellent opportunity to cool your nerves and collectively move forward with the project roadmap regardless of the results of this summer’s parachain auctions.
