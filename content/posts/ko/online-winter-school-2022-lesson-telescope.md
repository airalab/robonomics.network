In this lesson, we will show you possibly our most inspiring app so far. We love the space theme and we all look forward to the James Web Telescope revealing to mankind the secrets of the early state of the universe.

In the meantime, we want to give you the opportunity to explore the observable universe in an entertaining way and make yourself or your loved ones a beautiful NFT of deep space.

To do this, we connected a real robotized telescope in the Atacama Desert in Chile. You can connect to it and take a real-time photo of a nebula or a star cluster and our application will mint an NFT for you on the RMRK Singular platform!

Watch this video from Chile:

The telescope takes photos in real-time, so the app only works from 11pm to 6am Santiago, Chile, and when the weather is good and clear.

In this experiment, we wanted to look at the interaction between the digital and physical worlds. Think about it, using this application, you are essentially looking from the metaverse on our universe!

We see that the line between the digital and physical worlds is blurring, and despite the fact that this may seem like a scary trend, it seems to us that people will only benefit from this.  Cyber-physical systems are already being used to organize society and we hope that the tools that the Robonomics team works on will help developers create useful CPS that improve people's lives.

### Now you can mint the Deep Space NFT here:

After you have the NFT - you can get a special role in [the Robonomics Discord](https://discord.gg/JpaN2XAmqY), where we will discuss how to connect the metaverses to our real world!

We hope you enjoy it!
