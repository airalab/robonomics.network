Coase discusses the impact of transaction costs (the cost of collecting and processing information) to make decisions about the conclusion of a contract and to monitor its implementation. The firm, with all its hierarchical extra-market structure, is formed as the most efficient way to provide the consumer with the target product with the lowest transaction costs at the moment, when the transactional effort to create the same product through multiple exchanges on the market between individuals becomes much higher. To best visualize this process, look at the illustrative example of buying a car.
