        <p>Blockchain technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum introduced the concept of decentralized digital value, free from territorial boundaries. These networks are governed by game theory, open-source communication protocols, and decentralized consensus mechanisms. Their value is protected by the collective agreement of network participants, with incentives aligned through token economics.</p>
        <p>However, traditional blockchains face limitations in the tokenization of non-digital assets. Since blockchains operate on predefined algorithms, they struggle to integrate real-world data and physical commodities without centralized intermediaries. IoT devices, however, offer a solution by acting as autonomous data providers for the blockchain.</p>

        <p>IoT devices generate data based on algorithmic measurements and can serve as impartial, objective sources of truth. When this data is verified and stored on the blockchain, it can become the basis for creating new digital units of value. These units, or tokens, can be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Globally traded</li>
          <li>Transparent and immutable</li>
          <li>Backed by data and energy from machines</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This method ensures a secure and verifiable way to represent real-world activity in a digital format, unlocking the potential for machine-driven economies.</p>
