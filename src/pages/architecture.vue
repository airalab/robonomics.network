Robonomics supports several uses for ROS. The implementation of Robonomics for the Ethereum network is in the form of the ROS package robonomics_comm. For the ROS 2 architecture, we implement support for Robonomics as a middleware layer (see «Robonomics as ROS 2 Middleware» for details). When the use of ROS is redundant (e.g., when working with IoT devices), a Python robonomics-interface module has been developed. It helps to access the functions of Robonomics natively and works with both local and private and remote and public nodes.`)}}</p>
