The Robonomics team wants to impact the Kusama network development with scenarios for personal use in your home! We will show: how you can interact with the most popular sensors (such as Aqara/Xiaomi) over Kusama, how you can connect up a co-working space to be under the control of a Kusama Parachain, and more…

## The workshop program

### Part 1: Introduction to IoT 2022

At the beginning of the master class, we will look at the most popular scenarios where we use the Internet of Things in 2022. We will also look at the standard scheme of interaction between IoT applications on your phone and smart devices in your home. We will learn about the current problems of building IoT solutions.

### Part 2: Lights up!

Let’s discuss the most popular open source home assistant solution and go through the main stages of its installation, configuration and explain how to connect sensors to the assistant.

Then we are going to try a simple decentralized application in conjunction with the polkadot.js extension to turn on a smart light bulb. After that we will send the first transaction to the Kusama network and find out how IoT subscriptions work in the Robonomics parachain.

### Part 3: Co-working administrator case

Let's consider a more complex scenario from the IoT world. You are the administrator of a co-working space in Berlin, but you left for 3 months to enjoy a vacation in Bali. How can we organize a secure scenario for managing co-working users, where we can remotely & regularly receive data from smart devices, all without using a connection to centralized cloud services?

### Part 4: Robonomics use cases today and tomorrow

In the final part of the master class, we will talk about Web3 application scenarios in the field of IoT which have already been launched. You can familiarize yourself with these scenarios, and try to interact with them on your own after the lesson is over.

## We invite everyone who is interested to learn about the use of Web3 technologies!

To fully participate in the master class, you will need a laptop with the [polkadot.js extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) installed. However we also invite listeners who would like to learn more about the use of Polkadot in scenarios from the IoT and robotics world.
