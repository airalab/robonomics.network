## The Longest open source Chain of 2024!   

What you saw at the beginning of the video (turning on the light from a phone) is a unique example of a fully open-source solution covering all stages of interaction between a person and a smart device. To date, this is the only experiment successfully demonstrating a hybrid (cloud-local) and fully integrated IoT solution, entirely built on open-source technologies!

1. The light switch operates on the open-source Tasmota firmware and is built using open blueprints from Robonomics Hardware.   
2. It is connected to the smart home server, based on RISC-V architecture, via the open-source MQTT protocol implementation — Mosquitto. RISC-V is one of the few open architectures for single-board computers that is actively evolving.   
3. The RISC-V computer runs Linux and Home Assistant, creating a local smart home system. Home Assistant is the most popular open-source smart home project in the world! As for Linux, no further explanation is needed.   
4. Thanks to the integration of Robonomics with Home Assistant, the smart home is connected to Polkadot. The Robonomics engineers have assembled all the necessary dependencies to enable the RISC-V computer to communicate with the Polkadot parachain. After activating the subscription, the smart home server created a digital twin on the Robonomics parachain within Polkadot.   
5. The user accessed the Robonomics Dapp via Nova Wallet and, using self-generated keys, sent the "Robonomics Jam" command.   
6. The smart home server, integrated with Robonomics, detected changes in the digital twin and performed the corresponding actions in the physical world.   

All elements of the demo — from the user application and connection services to the cloud and home devices — are fully open-source and built with the Robonomics platform!  

## Robonomics open source Platform: Full Stack DePIN for the Polkadot Ecosystem   

During our time in the Polkadot ecosystem, the Robonomics team has published 25 significant repositories,  215 releases, and made around 20,000 code commits that can benefit the community. Among our pinned repositories, you'll find not only the network node's source code but also software solutions for connecting devices and robots directly to decentralized user applications built on Polkadot!

In future publications, we will take a closer look at how developers in the Polkadot ecosystem can integrate the Robonomics platform into their projects.   

## How Much Activity Was Generated on the Kusama Network   

We are embarking on our journey in Polkadot with nearly three years of experience in experiments and real-world projects on the Kusama network. Over the 1006 days of the Robonomics parachain's existence on Kusama (since January 9, 2022), more than 80% of all extrinsics contained meaningful data: device activations, telemetry publications, or changes to the state of digital twins. In total, Robonomics-based projects generated over 5 million extrinsics. We also tested interactions with six other parachains, resulting in about 3,000 transactions. Additionally, we gained valuable experience in on-chain governance, processing 294 technical committee proposals and 25 treasury requests.

Thank you, Kusama, for the time we’ve spent together. The Kusama network will continue to play an important role in Robonomics solutions as the platform for Freemium smart home subscriptions.   

## The Journey is Made by Those Who Walk It   

We will continue to uphold the spirit of open source at Robonomics, building an open and accessible network for engineers and enthusiasts who are ready to take on exciting and complex challenges. Our next step is launching the first products for end users, based on the Robonomics platform. This will not only showcase the power of our code but also create a load on Polkadot that far exceeds that of Kusama, helping the ecosystem integrate Robonomics solutions into any applications built on Polkadot.

Stay tuned for updates on the "Hardware for Cyberpunks 2025" project!   

Thank you to everyone who has supported us over the years!
