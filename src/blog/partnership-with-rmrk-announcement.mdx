[Kanaria](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/) is the most advanced NFT project in the world built on the world’s most advanced NFT protocol: [RMRK](https://rmrk.app/).
Kanaria NFTs are birds that can own and even equip other NFTs, building an item economy that can span not only different projects (automatic cross project compatibility) but also different chains due to being launched on Kusama - a “Layer 0” for chains to connect through. Kanaria are also the precursor to RMRK’s upcoming metaverse - [Kanaria: Skybreach](https://url.rmrk.app/meta).

Robonomics has committed to supporting the addition of RMRK’s pallets into their runtime, thereby integrating natively with the world’s most advanced NFT logic (the addition is still subject to community governance vote). This integration allows RMRK 2.0 NFTs to natively exist on Robonomics' upcoming parachain, and has implications for the extension and exploration of how NFTs built on the RMRK standard can be utilized in IoT applications and complex robotics.

As one of the first projects engaging and building within the Polkadot ecosystem, Robonomics offers a platform to build Web3 robotic solutions and applications for use cases within supply chain, payments systems, production, digital passports, and *robots-as-a-service*.

RMRK on the other hand will reward the top 500 crowdloaners [participating in Robonomics crowdloan](https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot/). These champions will be airdropped a special Kanaria-compatible item - a child NFT that can be equipped onto one’s Kanaria bird, and may bestow advantages in [RMRK’s metaverse](https://url.rmrk.app/meta).

You do not have to have a Kanaria bird to get this bonus item, but you do have to be in the top 500 contributors.

## About Robonomics

Robonomics is an open-source platform for IoT applications. They support a new generation of internet technologies (Web3) that implements the exchange of technical and economic information in the form of atomic transactions between user applications, IoT services, and complex robotics.

The Robonomics platform provides tools for working with the robot economy network. Robonomics allow designers of smart cities and industry 4.0 zones to build trust among the autonomous robots services, provide direct user access via dapp for ordering products from autonomous factories and services of urban sensor networks. This in turn allows Robonomics and it’s users to put in place a decentralized system that globally monitors the activities of cyber physical systems.


## About RMRK

[RMRK](https://rmrk.app/) is a team spearheading the development of the RMRK protocol for creating highly composeable “NFT legos” using NFTs on the [Kusama](https://kusama.network/).

Among others, RMRK brings the following features to the NFT table:

* emoting to NFTs on chain
* custom burn messages
* NFTs owning NFTs
* NFTs that have conditional rendering (if this, show that)
* NFTs that have slots for upgrades
* NFTs that have multi-resources (i.e. contain both code for a game and high-res cover art)
* NFTs that can be governed as DAOs

It thereby far exceeds what the current ERC721 / ERC1155 standards and their derivatives can do.
