> Robonomics community incentive program's goal is to provide **developers**, **ambassadors** and **influencers** with **XRT** for their contributions.

Thus, the core Robonomics DAO allocated 10.000 XRT under the management of the marketing department representative.
Those funds will be under the control of Robonomics marketing DAO. Who’s responsible for rewarding **developers** and communicating with **ambassadors** & **influencers**.

Developers, engineers and researchers as the core drive force of the robotics industry will get rewards for research and development activities based on Robonomics Network.
