Today, we live in a world where we rely more on technology more than ever before, the fear of being disconnected is real, and it’s only growing. With the number of smart, useful devices set to skyrocket in the next five years, the idea of “cutting the digital umbilical cord” from corporate clouds and surviving sounds impossible.   
But the engineers at Robonomics know how to guide you toward a self-sovereign digital life where your tech only answers to you.

**The event consists of three key elements:**

**AI Agent “Tyler Durden”** – Your personal guide to unplugging from corporate clouds.

**Season Pass: “Monkey Astronaut”** – Your access pass to the Paper St. Club, and once activated you’ll earn achievements and participate in exclusive community events.

**Achievement System “The Digital Freedom Hall of Fame”** – Track your and the community's progress and try to become a part of the next generation of digital autonomy, a virtual Martian colony.

## The Paper St. Club   
Yes, we’re referencing Fight Club. Just like Tyler Durden’s frustration with the consumer culture, today’s world is even more complex. We’re not just losing ourselves to materialism, but to corporate-controlled technology. Afraid of surrendering your life to centralized systems? It’s already happening, worse yet, we’re balancing on the edge of digital enslavement, with tech giants like Amazon pulling the strings. We’re here for those daring enough to experiment and reclaim their digital freedom.

For years, our team has developed a complete chain of open-source solutions; from software to hardware devices that empower you to break and live free from corporate cloud control. For the first time, you’ll have the chance to join us in reshaping our digital spaces.

Together, we’ll share experiences, compete, and host exclusive offline events. This is your invitation to the basement at Paper St., but you’ll need your “Monkey Astronaut” card to get in.

## AI Coach “Tyler Durden”   
Nothing supernatural here, just the magic of AI. We will create an AI agent, loaded with Tyler Durden’s rebellious spirit, and train it with a three-year development program from the Robonomics engineers. Tyler will assist all the "Astronauts Monkey's" in the club helping the transition to digital autonomy.

Tyler will assign tasks - not as eccentric as in the original work, but we hope just as interesting. The main goal is to help you achieve digital autonomy at the household level within a few months. Tyler will help you create a digital twin of your environment and monitor its status throughout the season pass duration. He’ll guide you in transitioning from corporate solutions to open-source technologies and will recognize your achievements on the club’s "Hall of Fame."

## Season Pass: “Monkey Astronaut”

Entrance to the club is by pass only. This helps us manage the workload of supporting participants. The pass not only grants you entry but includes the training and hardware devices needed for the journey with free worldwide shipping!

The starting price of the season pass is 420 DAI, available on OpenSea starting November 7, 2024.

### First Offline Event for Club Members
Heading to Bangkok from November 7 to 15? We’ve planned a [city quest inspired by Neuromancer](https://x.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1844293067009929439) by William Gibson, exclusively for season pass holders.

## The Digital Freedom Hall of Fame
Achieving digital autonomy unlocks far more than just control over your devices, it’s the gateway to the future of networked communities or the so called “network states.” The Hall of Fame will track community progress, gauging who is ready to build the first autonomous enclave under the slogan; “Who is John Galt?”

## In Conclusion  
This is going to be an exhilarating experience. Choose the months that work best for you in 2025, activate your season pass, and let Tyler guide you. At the very least, you’ll understand the digital shadows your personal devices cast. At best, you’ll become one of the 0.001% truly free people in the modern world.

“It’s only after we’ve lost everything that we’re free to do anything.”
