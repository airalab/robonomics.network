We are happy to announce that [Moonbeam](http://moonbeam.network/), a сross-сhain connected smart contract platform, and Robonomics Network have started collaborating by opening a set of bilateral HRMP channels between Moonriver and Robonomics parachains. The XRT token can now be used as [xcXRT](https://moonbeam.network/announcements/moonriver-adds-cross-chain-capabilities-and-xcksm/) across the Moonriver ecosystem.

With this integration, Robonomics can leverage Moonriver smart contracts into our parachain on Kusama. In particular, we are interested in a scenario where the launch and datalog functions are called from a smart contract. This feature allows us to take on-chain data and be able to translate that into real-world events, which is especially important for smart device applicability.

In August, Moonbeam announced a proof-of-concept of [XCM-to-EVM functionality](https://moonbeam.network/announcements/xcm-to-evm-functionality-moonbase-alpha/) on Moonbase Alpha TestNet. This allows developers on remote chains to trigger function calls on the Moonriver/Moonbeam platforms, allowing them to tap into the features of the developer-friendly EVM on their home chains. If remote EVM calls through XCM are enabled on Moonbeam ecosystem, then IoT devices and applications of Robonomics will be able to remotely call smart contracts on Moonriver with the native security of the Kusama chain, through XCM. This opens up an entirely new realm of possibilities for IoT devices that work on Robonomics parachain, as they’ll be able to access the immutability and security of smart contracts.

We are looking forward to new functional upgrades to build a truly decentralized world of robotics, IoT and smart devices!

## About Moonbeam

Moonbeam is a smart contract platform for building cross-chain connected applications that can access users, assets, and services on any chain. By uniting functionality from Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, and more into a single platform, Moonbeam solves today’s fragmented user experience — unlocking true interoperability and paving the way for the next generation of applications. The Moonbeam platform uses integrated cross-chain messaging to allow developers to create smart contracts that access services across many remote blockchains. This approach, plus Moonbeam’s developer-friendly EVM platform, vast tool support, and modern Substrate architecture, creates the ideal development environment for building connected applications.

## About Robonomics

Robonomics Network — a decentralized cloud for secure and reliable control of IoT applications. It incorporates decentralization, blockchain technologies and token-based economics for the protection of smart devices and their data. Robonomics is aimed at: 1) control of smart devices with security and global availability, 2) serverless IoT applications for users for their privacy, 3) performing technical & economic transactions between people to machines and machine to machine for service efficiency. Moreover, the Robonomics parachain has an IoT subscription function that allows users to send device transactions without fee, for a period of one month. This allows, in particular, to make the smart home completely sovereign of centralized service providers, while keeping the ability to securely and remotely access devices at home.
