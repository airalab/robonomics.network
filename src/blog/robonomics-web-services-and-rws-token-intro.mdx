**Robonomics Web Services (RWS)** is decentralized infrastructure services over IPFS, Ethereum, and Polkadot for Robotics and IoT. For industrial, consumer, and commercial solutions.

## Meet the first RWS IoT Core services
RWS is a state-of-the-art infrastructure that you will love. RWS lets connect devices easily and interact with user applications, cloud services, and other devices securely. No single point of failure, open-source, most interesting internet tech on a turn-key basis, and your freedom to use it in any place in the world. Truly global network for Robotics and IoT devices.

The first RWS IoT Core services over Robonomics Parachain:

* **RWS: PubSub Message Broker.** Use unlimited messaging over a P2P network based on IPFS protocol.
* **RWS: Data Blockchainization Service.** Put data into IPFS and store hashes in a public Blockchain.
* **RWS: Robot Actions.** Switch on / off; launch or stop your IoT devices under control of decentralized computer.

## Let’s begin subscription model experiment with RWS token
The main token of Robonomics network is XRT. This is utility token which your robotics / IoT devices can use to pay transactions fee to interact over Ethereum today. Soon, XRT will give your robotics systems the same opportunity in the Polkadot ecosystem with Robonomics Parachain.

For engineers, Core Dev team will try to make different Robonomics usage models and the first step in this way is launching lifetime subscription token — RWS token. As Tesla promoted their roadster with lifetime charging, so we want to promote Robonomics network with lifetime subscription offer for the first. Become a robot economy pioneers!

> ### 1 RWS token will give you 1 transaction per second (tps) from/to your IoT device over Robonomics Parachain.
>
> Just activate your RWS token and make more than 2,500,000 tx in a month with no time limits. Deactivate RWS token and trade it on Uniswap any time you want.

**Example case 1:** You own 0.1 RWS token and want to share telemetry with shadow in Public blockchain every 10 seconds. You need to activate it with transaction to special address of ethereum mainnet smart contract. After that, you can use RWS: Data Blockchainization Service each 10 seconds (1 RWS token == 1 tps, 0.1 RWS token == 1 tx / 10 sec).

**Example case 2:** You own 2 RWS token and want to control automatic car wash under Robonomics control. You need to activate it with transaction to special address of ethereum mainnet smart contract. After that, you can use RWS: Data Blockchainization Service and RWS: Robot Actions each second in parallel mode.

**Current status of RWS token:** initial distribution stage.

**Total supply:** 100 RWS tokens which will present lifetime using of 100 tps Robonomics Parachain bandwidth.

**Distribution plans:**
* 50 RWS tokens will be distributed via [Uniswap XRT/RWS pair](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x42018a2ff89b6d662b5f746277bd02f0d85f485a).
* 50 RWS tokens will be reserved for academia and non-profit organizations.

**Expected time to launch RWS token functions:**
* alpha version — Q3 2020
* beta version — Q4 2020

**Further emission of RWS.** Benchmarks of Polkadot Parachains indicate that 100 tps is a small part of potential bandwidth of Robonomics Parachain. At the same time, Core Dev team want to make different types of subscriptions. From our perspective, RWS token is pioneers’ especial offer. And in future, we will focus on other types of RWS tokens with monthly and other types of limitations of using Robonomics Web Services for Robotics and IoT devices.

## Conclusion
Robonomics Web Services is the new branch of evolution in Robonomics project. Earlier, we only said we have Software platform, Decentralized network Providers, and some use cases based on our technologies. From now on Robonomics project made step on the way to bring something at least as good as Amazon Web Services but on the top of new internet technologies wave. It still R&D and experimental, but pioneers who would like to be the first in new fields are welcome! More Services in RWS IoT Core and not only in core will be presented this summer. Alpha version will start as soon as possible.
