# Cyberpunk Hardware && Cyberpunk Lab - Two Initiatives for the Polkadot Community by Robonomics   

As we transitioned towards a production laboratory, I didn't want to lose the research potential for the future. Back in the summer of 2024, it was hard to envision how to make this happen. I focused on turning all the R&D developments within our team into live projects with a unified vision. This led to the creation of the Hardware for Cyberpunks brand, and only after its launch did we begin addressing research in robotics. Things became even more complex, but after three months, our team is now close to applying our accumulated experience in robotics R&D and launching a crypto-friendly investment model for a production company. We have adapted, and today, I want to introduce two programs that will help develop the open-source OG Robonomics project and its infrastructure.   


## Cyberpunk Lab - Polkadot Humanoid Robot SDK   

Cyberpunk Lab is an bold initiative aimed at pushing the boundaries of humanoid robotics, artificial intelligence, and decentralized technologies. With confirmed locations in San Francisco (California) and Shenzhen (China), this research lab will serve as a launchpad for the Polkadot Humanoid SDK, enabling seamless integration of humanoid robots into the Web3 ecosystem.   

By combining cutting-edge robotics technologies with Polkadot cloud capabilities, we are building a framework for secure, autonomous, and decentralized machine interactions. This lab will act as a proving ground, where researchers, artists, and developers can create, test, and validate real-world applications, laying the foundation for the next phase of technological evolution.   


### Our experience with humanoid robots:   

- Over 10 years in research robotics.   
- The only team in the crypto industry showcasing Web3 applications in robotics since 2015.   
- Developed multiple integrations for standard robotics software with Ethereum, IPFS, and Polkadot.   
- In December 2024, we acquired our first humanoid robot and began working on its capabilities.   
   
The best outcome of this experience is the development of an SDK toolset for developers who need standardized cloud services for telemetry transmission, identity management, crypto payments, and even smart contract execution. We will merge functionalities from multiple Polkadot-based applications, ensuring that developers can quickly integrate Polkadot into their humanoid robotics projects—and most importantly, it will work.   

To achieve this, we have partnered with several projects in California, which Vitaly will elaborate on soon. We are launching two physical labs—in San Francisco and Shenzhen—to fine-tune the functions of the Polkadot Humanoid Robot SDK and eliminate the biggest barrier to entry—“this thing won’t start!”. Our goal is to ensure SDK reliability across popular humanoid robot models.  

We have also partnered with artists and are in discussions with universities to conduct collaborative research, verifying the quality of the SDK we are developing. This strategic, three-pronged approach is being led by those who know how to get things done.   

To finance the development of the Polkadot Humanoid Robot SDK, we have secured partners and will request additional funding through Polkadot’s On-Chain Governance. Support our proposal! This is valuable for the entire ecosystem and will cost less than some one-time events. With this funding, we can retain our R&D team and direct its efforts toward a highly ambitious initiative, beneficial for both Robonomics and the Polkadot ecosystem.   


## Cyberpunk Hardware: Consumer Tech Brand with DAO Structure and Prediction Market Economic Game for Investors   

Soon, I will publish a document on Robocorporation, outlining a new model for funding and managing production. This model is based on the principles of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), prediction markets, and the Internet of Things (IoT).   

Our goal is to create an autonomous system where investment and operational decisions are decentralized, guided by collective predictions and data from connected devices. This approach ensures more efficient capital distribution compared to traditional corporations.   

By early April, we will invite the crypto community to join Robocorporation and hope to secure funding to develop the hardware brand. Our objective is to launch a structure capable of continuously manufacturing devices and tech based on open-source blueprints and models from our team and the future cyberpunk community.   

Open-source hardware is the future of technology markets, which is why RISC-V is already gaining traction. We have released samples of our first devices and are actively engaging major DAO token holders. However, our goal is to build a pirate-style corporation—so we are calling on crypto enthusiasts to become token holders.   

Stay tuned! Once we finalize discussions with major investors and confirm support for manufacturing 10–12 devices over the next two years, we will officially invite participation in the Cyberpunk Hardware Community.   
   
Ultimately, we will bring Robonomics to life, deploy hundreds of humanoid robots, and allow them to offer services via Polkadot, while fostering a community capable of shaping the next era of technological advancement in consumer tech!
