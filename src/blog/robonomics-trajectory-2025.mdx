## Q1 2025: Expanding Foundations

#### 1. Humanoid Robots R&D

We're at the forefront of humanoid robotics, one of the first teams to dive deep into this emerging category. Through our work with [startups](https://x.com/vitl2907/status/1887346985361084436) and [developers](https://x.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1883973094949412983), we accelerate the development of real-world applications. We've seen early adoption at [CES](https://x.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1877326334516482452) and other events, running multiple public trials of human-robot interaction in natural environment. In 2025, it will become normal for humanoid robots to serve as hosts, guides, and entertainers. As the technology matures, we'll see broader deployment in senior care, e-commerce warehousing, and hazardous environments like firefighting.

We‚Äôre working with multiple universities and offering a track at [Stanford Tree Hacks](https://www.treehacks.com/), where students will create apps for our Unitree G1 robot!

#### 2. AIRA: Defining Cyber-Physical Agents

We started [Airalab](https://github.com/airalab) in 2015 exploring multi-agent systems in the context of market mechanisms. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AEmpKReDzE

Now, with AI-driven agents becoming mainstream, we plan to publish a new whitepaper on AIRA, an Autonomous Intelligent Robot Agent. It will outline the latest best practices in robotics development and how they intersect with decentralized market mechanisms‚Äîideas we've refined over the past decade.

#### 3. Hardware for Cyber Punks launch

üìç **ETH Denver 2025**

We're launching the first device in our Hardware for Cyberpunks lineup: an Altruist Outdoor Sensor. This isn't just a gadget‚Äîit's an open-source node in a trustless, citizen-run environmental monitoring network.

- Built on RISC-V (open-source processor)
- Open hardware & software, fully transparent
- Native to Robonomics Network & the broader Polkadot ecosystem

At ETH Denver, we'll showcase this with an interactive NFT-driven onboarding, giving hands-on experience at the Polkadot Demo Day workshop.

We believe environmental data should be public, trustless, and community-owned‚Äîand we've built a device and infrustructure from the ground up to respect these values.

## Q2 2025: Scaling Deployments

#### 1. Robocorporation: The Future of Hardware Funding

We will release a whitepaper on Robocorporation, continuing our research on [robust market mechanisms](https://robonomics.network/blog/ohf-part-1/) for financing hardware. This paper will define how communities can own and operate hardware and will present our vision of an autonomous governance system where liquidity flows efficiently into new categories of hardware, ranging from small sensors to humanoid robots.

Efficiently directing liquidity into robotics and consumer tech is key to building 21st-century infrastructure rooted in direct ownership and trustless principles.

#### 2. Agentic AI and novel training methods for robots

We will push further exploring Reinforcement Learning (RL) in robotics and expanding our Polkadot collaborations.

We've already tested running Llama 3.2 on [Acurast's compute clusters](https://acurast.com/) and have plans to strengthen our collaboration and power even more LLM-based use cases together. Just like we partnered with [Crust Network](https://robonomics.network/blog/robonomics-and-crust-networks-strategic-partnership/) for storage in 2022, we are excited to integrate Acurast distributed compute to use the next-gen, decentralized cloud ecosystem.

This year we will finally have decentralized storage and compute partners to power humanoid robotics and other resource-constrained edge devices, creating agentic AI ecosystem on Polkadot.

#### 3. Growing Hardware for Cyberpunks

Your home should be your most private space, controlled only by you. Not your keys, not your home!

That is why we will release Smart Home Server ‚Äì one of the first RISC-V microcomputers, built for privacy-first smart homes. We deliver open hardware with a fully functioning open cloud support with 3000+ smart home device integrations via Robonomics Network.

We will also release Hikikomori Tamagotchi Dev Board ‚Äì a programmable microcontroller that can sign transactions on Polkadot, display data on a built-in LCD screen, be hacked, integrated, and played with like a hardware Tamagotchi for Web3 developers. We're excited to put this in your hands and see how the community brings it to life.

There will always be custom and complex projects in the physical world, that is why [Pinout](https://pinout.cloud/) is an integral part of our ecosystem, implementing smart apartments, houses, and office buildings. They provide expert consultation on hardware selection, installation, and support for smart home solutions. By working with Pinout, users can deploy complex automation projects with hundreds of devices and have piece of mind that engineers will deliver top notch solution.

## Q3 2025: Decentralized Governance 

#### 1. Dawn of Robocorporation

The most important milestone is pushing forward financing of working capital in hardware businesses. We're moving beyond theory‚Äîthis is the time to activate real liquidity into hardware ownership. This is the time to build!

Our goal is to allow people to directly fund and co-own physical infrastructure. We're actively exploring real-world asset (RWA) partnerships to bridge the gap between capital and physical infrastructure. If the world of tomorrow runs on robotic automation, it should also be owned by the people who believe in and build it now.

#### 2. Season Pass: Unifying the Robonomics Experience

Over the years, we've minted many NFTs for different experiences‚Äîinteractions with [robots](https://x.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1887188483308974210), [events](https://robonomics.network/blog/return-to-canvas-art-in-the-world-of-technology/), and even [a telescope](https://robonomics.network/blog/online-winter-school-2022-lesson-telescope/). In 2025 we aim to create a seemless journey across our ecosystem with the launch of Robonomics Season Pass.

Over the past decade Robonomics has become more than just a project‚Äîit‚Äôs a vision of decentralizing the physical world‚Äôs infrastructure. Now, as we push forward, we want to bring together those who recognize the depth of our commitment‚Äîpioneers who see trustless physical systems as the key to autonomy. Every season we will release new devices, events and experiences to guide you on the Cyber Punk journey and connect people together. Our open hardware means that it can be assembled anywhere and local governance is critical to build reliable physical infrastructure networks.

The Season Pass will also make it easier for people to discover, join, and contribute to key projects, such as [FEECC](https://robonomics.network/blog/feecc-recap/) ‚Äì a blockchain-backed quality control system for manufacturing, and [Otaberu](https://robonomics.network/blog/otaberu-part-1/) ‚Äì A robotics fleet management system built for the decentralized era.

#### 3. Energy Monitor: final piece of the hardware puzzle

This will be the most challenging launch in Hardware for Cyberpunks, requiring complex certifications that few companies tackle. But we believe that understanding your energy grid use is critical, and we're offering the most non-invasive solution in the industry to achieve this. This device will let you track, analyze, and connect your grid to Dapps with minimal disruption, setting a new standard for energy monitoring.

## Q4 2025: Hardware Expansion

#### 1. RWA Chip: Embedding Smart Contracts into Everything

The biggest breakthrough of Q4 is expected to be the launch of our Real-World Asset (RWA) Chip, built on the experience with Hikikomori microcontroller. This chip can sign transactions and be embedded into complex cyber-physical systems like robots and smart buildings. With this we will enable any real-world agent to own, manage, and participate in economic activities autonomously.

Imagine a building leasing its own space oa robot earning for its own upgrades‚Äîall governed on-chain. This initiative forms the backbone of decentralized equipment leasing, seamlessly integrating into the broader Robonomics ecosystem.

#### 2. Events Roadshow: Bringing DePIN Revolution to Major Cities

With our hardware ecosystem maturing, we plan to take the movement on the road. We'll launch an events roadshow travelling to major cities to set up hands-on activities where people can see, touch and try devices ranging from smart home devices everybody need to still novel humanoid robots. They‚Äôll learn what it means to own physical infrastructure in a decentralized world, breaking beyond digital networks. Most importantly, they‚Äôll connect with the builders, investors, and pioneers shaping the future of robotic and smart infrastructure.

#### 3. New Devices: AI Smart Speaker & Surveillance-Free Robot Vacuum

We plan to kick off the holiday season by announcing a new wave of devices, including:

- **Private AI Smart Speaker** ‚Äì A voice assistant without corporate surveillance, designed for privacy-first smart homes.
- **Surveillance-Free Robot Vacuum** ‚Äì A fully autonomous cleaning robot that doesn't spy on you‚Äîno hidden data collection, just smart automation.
- **More devices we're still cooking up** ‚Äì Expect a lineup of 20+ boundary-pushing tech that fits into our Cyberpunk Hardware vision.

With this, we'll have a full lineup of open, decentralized consumer devices, proving that privacy and security don't have to be sacrificed for convenience.

## Final Thoughts

At this stage, we consider Robonomics Network a complete project. We closely follow [JAM's](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-jam-chain) updates, but our key focus right now is onboarding hardware that will drive demand for Robonomics Network cloud services.

The physical infrastructure layer is the final piece of the puzzle that we have been assembling for the past 10 years. Our goal is to have open, secure and well-integrated hardware solutions that align with Cyber Punk ideals and run on trustless infrastructure.

Robonomics Hardware is not just building devices: we set the foundation for the physical world.
