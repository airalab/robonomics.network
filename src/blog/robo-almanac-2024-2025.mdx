This publication captures the key outcomes of the past year and offers an inspiring vision for 2025. Continuing a tradition that began in 2017, it documents the evolution of our technologies and approaches, showcasing how Robonomics is transforming the world.

## What’s inside?

Each issue serves as a guide to the cutting edge of modern internet technologies and robotics. The 2024 review features the most exciting events, achievements, and inspiring stories:

- **Hardware for Cyberpunks — Technology for the People:**
    
    In 2024, Robonomics introduced new hardware solutions that make Web3 accessible to everyone. Our focus was on open-source smart devices, such as energy monitors, air quality sensors, and autonomous servers for smart homes.
    
- **JohnnyB’s Lab:**
    
    Expanding the lineup of robots and elevating experiments to new levels, the lab welcomed:
    
    - **TurtleBot 4** — a mobile platform with computer vision.
    - **Mini Pupper** (versions 1 and 2) — four-legged robots integrated with Web3.
    - **myBuddy 280** — a two-armed robot ideal for multi-agent tasks.
    - **Unitree G1 Humanoid** — an experimental platform for studying human-robot interaction in the Web3 world.
    We don’t just develop robots — we teach them to thrive in the Web3 ecosystem. Read how our experiments transform robotics into decentralized agents ready for real-world tasks.
- **G.E.C.K. Project: The Smart Home of the Future in Bali**
    
    An experiment in creating a future home on the island of Bali, where all management systems are built on Web3 technologies.
    
    **Key idea:** integrating physical objects with Web3 to create autonomous homes that offer comfort, sustainability, and independence from centralized systems anywhere in the world.
    
    The G.E.C.K. project is more than an experiment; it’s a significant step toward building homes that embody Web3 philosophy: freedom, autonomy, and sustainability.

- **Web3 Innovations and Success Stories:**
    - **Smart Home Automation and Pinout's Achievements:** One of the year's highlights was smart home automation with integration into decentralized networks. Special attention is given to **Pinout**, a smart home integrator in Cyprus.
    - **JohnnyB Tutor:** As a Web3 guide, JohnnyB conducted lectures and events in 2024, demystifying the use of decentralized networks in robotics, IoT, and DePIN.
    - **Web3 in Entertainment — DroneSelfie:** A transformative project showcasing how Web3 technologies redefine the entertainment industry, offering personalized media packages securely stored in decentralized networks.
    - **Art Experiment and Digital Passports:** In 2024, artworks received digital passports through Web3, documenting their creation in the blockchain. A mobile studio with smart lighting showcased the seamless integration of technology and art.

- **Plans for 2025:**
    A strong focus on Polkadot, launching new devices, and advancing the concept of decentralized management for smart homes and robots.
