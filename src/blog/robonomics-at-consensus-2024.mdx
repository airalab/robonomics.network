Win 500 DOT for 1st place and the latest Razer laptop for 2nd at the Coindesk Consensus Hackathon! And Raspberry Pi 5s to install your self-hosted smart home for top-3 winners.

Join us for a unique and exciting track focused on using Robonomics for smart home and robotics use cases. We offer remote access to two cutting-edge labs:

- **Boston Dynamics Spot Lab:** Work with the renowned Boston Dynamics Spot, a quadrupedal robot known for its agility and maneuverability. Explore how to control Spot using Web3 tools, create decentralized applications (dApps) for Spot, or use Spot's data to develop innovative services.
- **Smart Home Lab:** At present, Polkadot is one of the largest DAOs in the world! There are many interesting events taking place in the ecosystem as part of the on-chain governance experiment. Robonomics developers suggest that hackathon participants increase Polkadot community immersion by integrating events related to voting, new treasury requests, epoch changes, and much more, into a typical smart home system.

With our track, you'll have the opportunity to:

- Explore the potential of blockchain technology in the smart home and robotics industries
- Gain hands-on experience working with cutting-edge robotics and smart home equipment
- Collaborate with a global community of developers, engineers, and enthusiasts
- Win exciting prizes and recognition for your innovative projects: A top-of-the-line Razer laptop, smart home equipment, and 500 DOT cash prize!

**Boston Dynamic Spot Lab Description**

Here are the instructions to work with Spot: https://merklebot.notion.site/Docs-for-RoboHackathon-b057d24828194c78bac53a3885305382?pvs=4

The SDK is relatively straightforward and we offer an easy-to-use platform to deploy your code to the robots directly.

The robot has a microphone, speaker, and camera so you can build use cases utilizing that equipment. For example, issuing an NFT certificate based on the sound or video data captured by the robot; or exploring ideas of how you can pay the robot to perform certain tasks, like going somewhere and inspecting a part of our lab.

**Smart Home Lab Description**

In the Robonomics wiki, we have prepared a guide with an example of launching an autonomous agent. This agent allows you to link on-chain gov events with smart devices, such as a light bulb. The instruction is available at the link: https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/on-chain-gov-experiment/

At the initial stage of the hackathon, a mentor from Robonomics will provide anyone interested with access to the demo stand of a standard smart apartment. This stand will be available online 24/7. On this stand, developers can test their solutions and record real demonstrations of their code for the final presentation.

[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/k9G2WQWcmj) to start looking for teammates and discuss your ideas with the team. We are excited to see what you’ll build at Consensus this year and our team will be there to support you!
