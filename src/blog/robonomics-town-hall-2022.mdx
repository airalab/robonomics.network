We have a few voting topics for the community:

1. Vote to burn 7 million XRT
2. Parachain Governance version 2 R&D interest
3. Home Assistant support grants
4. ROS2 support grants
5. Web3 smart home ecosystem funding forecast

## General information about Town Hall 2022

The Town Hall will be the first meeting of XRT token holders, and we will discuss the tokenomics of the project.

**Ways which you can participate:** 

- On the Ethereum network using [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org/). Direct Link: [https://snapshot.org/#/developers.robonomics.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/developers.robonomics.eth)
- On the Kusama network using [polkassembly.io](http://polkassembly.io/). Direct link: [https://robonomics.polkassembly.io/](https://robonomics.polkassembly.io/)

**Timeline:** 

- **Voting launch**: from August 28 to September 3;
- **Duration of the voting period**: from August 28 to October 2;
- Finalization and publication of vote results in our blog: mid-October.

### Snapshot Voting Mechanics

Snapshot allows token holders to vote on community proposals without spending ETH on gas fees. This is because you do not need to send a transaction to the Ethereum network, instead you simply sign a message with your accounts private key. You should vote with the address in which you hold ERC-20 XRT tokens.

**The most important thing to remember about Snapshot voting:**

In order to vote on each proposal, you must have been holding ERC-20 XRT tokens at the time (block) that the vote was created. This means that if you try to vote on a proposal with ERC-20 XRT tokens which were acquired after the creation of the vote, your vote will not be counted.

Voting type: [Single choice voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types#single-choice-voting). A simple vote, choose your response to the question. Your voting weight is equal to the amount of XRT in your account’s balance.

### Polkassembly Voting Mechanics

The Robonomics parachain on Kusama has recently added a user-friendly interface (thanks to our friends at Polkassembly!) which makes it easier for accessing the parachain’s referendum module.

The functionality of voting on the parachain is practically identical to voting on the Kusama Relay Chain. Therefore, if you have ever participated in governance voting within the Dotsama ecosystem, then you should already be familiar with this process.

The vote which is initiated on the Robonomics parachain will have the same vote options as the Snapshot vote on Ethereum.

An important feature of the vote on the parachain is the conviction mechanism, that could also be referred to as “**Voluntary Locking”.** With this mechanism you can increase the weight of your vote (voting power) by increasing the lock up period for your tokens (note: during the lockup period, your tokens cannot be transferred). For example, if you select a voting power of 0.1x, then the XRT tokens that you chose to vote with will not be locked at all. However, if you choose to vote with 1x conviction (voting power), then your XRT tokens will be locked for a period of 8 days. Read more about this mechanism on the Polkadot wiki: [https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#voluntary-locking](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#voluntary-locking)

## Vote to burn 7 million XRT

This is the story of the sword of Damocles: 7 million XRT, which are currently locked in a Dutch auction smart contract on Ethereum. Is this a vestige of our project’s evolution? Or should it instead be kept as an untouchable reserve in order to one day be injected into the ecosystem to boost the development of the project? Read a detailed blog post about the history of the project’s tokenomics development in this article: [https://robonomics.network/blog/7-years-of-robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-xrt/](https://robonomics.network/blog/7-years-of-robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-xrt/)

## Parachain Governance version 2 R&D interest

Gavin Wood help a presentation based around upcoming updates to the on-chain protocol governance mechanism during the Polkadot Decoded 202 conference. You can read more about this here: [Gov2: Polkadot’s Next Generation of Decentralized Governance](https://polkadot.network/blog/gov2-polkadots-next-generation-of-decentralised-governance/). Robonomics plans to migrate to this new version of on-chain governance after the firsts tests have been completed on Kusama. During the Town Hall, our parachain’s developers would like to know how many community members would like to participate in the parachains governance systems with the introduction of Governance 2.0. If you are interested, then vote “for”, if you do not want to participate in the development of onchain protocol management, then you can simply skip this vote.

## Home Assistant support grants

One of the first, and the main use case we would like to advance for Robonomics in 2022-2023 is our integration with Home Assistant. Home Assistant has over half a million users, and is one of the best open source home automation solutions available today.

You can already purchase a Robonomics IoT subscription and [connect your home assistant to the Robonomics parachain](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/home-assistant-begin/). This will allow you to receive telemetry and control devices remotely, without the need to connect up to centralized cloud providers. These are only basic features, and there is demand for more useful services within smart homes. With this idea in mind, we propose to launch a mini-grants program (with grants \<5,000 DAI) aimed at generating ideas and easily implementing them in the form of Home Assistant automation scripts (in conjunction with the Robonomics parachain). As part of this vote, let’s determine how much XRT will be allocated to the total budget which will support the grants programme for the development of Home Assistant use cases for the next 6 months.

Every 20 XRT which votes “aye” will add 1 XRT to the Home Assistant grant budget, every 20 XRT “nay” will reduce the budget by 1 XRT.

## ROS2 support grants

Our origins are in robotics, and ROS (Robot Operating System) was the first area of experimentation for us. ROS, similar to Home Assistant, is the most popular open source framework, but not for home automation, instead it is for complex robotics. The first version of ROS had many problems that prevented it from taking it’s rightful place within real projects outside of laboratories and prototypes of start-up projects. The ROS community has been developing the ROS2 implementation for some time now, and it is already a more mature solution. The Robonomics team wants to continue the development & integration of ROS2 in 2022-2023. As part of this vote, let’s determine how much XRT will be allocated to the total budget which will support the grants programme for the development of ROS2-direction for the next 6 months.

Every 20 XRT which votes “aye” will add 1 XRT to the ROS2 grant budget, every 20 XRT “nay” will reduce the budget by 1 XRT.

## Web3 smart home ecosystem funding forecast

This topic requires an entire publication dedicated to it, so for now let’s focus on the first 4 questions as described here. This topic will be described separately closer to mid-September.
