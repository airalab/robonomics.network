Our internal tests of the open-source smart home server, built on RISC-V and connected to the Polkadot Web3 cloud, have been successfully completed! We now have a stable image and are launching sales of the dev kit version of what we see as the key element of every smart home over the next five years — a device control server.
   
We’ve created one of the most open implementations of a fully functional software stack, compatible with almost all smart home devices in the world. Now you can start building your home infrastructure with minimal risk of becoming the next episode of *Black Mirror*.
   
### Surveillance-free   
No hidden data logs on corporate servers while still allowing secure remote access.   

### No vendor lock-in   
Supports over 3000 integrations with devices from various manufacturers.   

### Open hardware   
Open processor architecture and open-source code ensure a trustless system.   

## Open and efficient hardware   
Our Home Server is powered by a RISC-V processor and features fully transparent circuit board schematics. RISC-V is an open and modular processor architecture that comes with a BSD license. Unlike proprietary ARM, it offers flexibility for customization without licensing restrictions, making it ideal for trustless IoT devices and servers.   

## Vendor agnostic smart home heart   
The server comes pre-installed with Home Assistant, an open-source home automation platform, giving you full control of your smart home without relying on third-party cloud services. Its modular design allows you to easily add components, automations, and integrations, supporting over 3,000 devices from various manufacturers without vendor lock-in. With
support for Zigbee and Wi-Fi protocols, you can connect a wide range of devices, from temperature sensors to energy consumption monitors, all to a local server.  

## Designed for privacy   
Our smart home server eliminates corporate interference, keeping your data local or encrypted with your personal key in decentralized Web3 storage. Enjoy complete privacy with no tracking, no surveillance—just secure, trustless control over your smart home.   
With Robonomics Web3 cloud and P2P remote control, you get cryptographic access to all the functions of smart home:   

- Access current device states remotely   
- Control devices remotely via parachain or LibP2P   
- Manage Home Assistant users   
- Back up and restore Home Assistant configurations   
- Store your home's digital twin in a secure, decentralized cloud
