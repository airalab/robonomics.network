*Updated XRT distribution plan available at [https://robonomics.network/community#token](https://robonomics.network/community#token)*

## Introduction

[The previous Distribution Plan](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZjzJbZDhs7B3YhtRkvdg4jp6qpfkVGB67w7vH2nJBUrE/Robonomics_token_Polkadot_KUSAMA_stage_details_september_2020.pdf) was released by Robonomics developers DAO back in September 2020. It covered a broad vision of the further migration to the Polkadot ecosystem. We find it necessary to provide the community with the <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYjv65UNTM3F7LFR1ESm5CVMLWYLagwtT7qGAsaBi47nY/releases_March'21_4v.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>updated version of the XRT Distribution Plan for Q2 2021 - Q1 2022 && 2022+</strong></a>

The article split into three stages:

- Past (includes an overview of the XRT distribution from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021);

- Present (covers the current XRT distribution Q2 2021 - Q1 2022);

- Future (elaborates the future of Robonomics in the Interoperability era 2022+).

## Past

During the Q1 2020 - Q1 2021 period, XRT circulation consists of 1,268,496 XRT.

![2020-2021](/blog/images/XRT-distribution/CircNow.png)

Let’s go through each variable:
- AIRA -> XRT holders swapped 686,640 out of 1,000,000 using the alembic smart contract;

- Robonomics developers DAO distributed 206,696 XRT to the community members via incentive programs:

  - Liquidity providers incentive program on Uniswap & Pancakeswap;

  - Robonomics Parachain collators reward program;

  - Big bag sales.

- Robonomics core developers grants for the period 2019 - Q1 2021 consists of 61,800 XRT.


## Present

### “Now” stage covers the Q2 2021 - Q1 2022 period:

![now2021](/blog/images/XRT-distribution/Total2021.png)

7,000,000 XRT locked until Robonomics developers DAO will merge tokenomics on Ethereum and Kusama.

Up to 502,000 XRT will be added to the circulation supply during the Q2 2021 - Q1 2022:

  - Robonomics developers DAO (up to 370,000 XRT);

  - Inflation (up to 132,100 XRT).

### Robonomics core developers DAO plans:
- 50% tokens (865,752) will migrate to Robonomics Parachain DAO Treasury after securing the Kusama parachain slot;

- Robonomics developers DAO will seal 495,752 XRT until the Interoperability era (2022+);

- Up to 100,000 XRT, depending on the market conditions, will be offered to Kusama holders during the [Parachain Lease Offering event](https://robonomics.network/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/);

  - Robonomics DAO allocated up to 85,000 XRT for core Robonomics developers grants during Q2 2021 - Q1 2022, [more about the roadmap](https://robonomics.network/blog/roadmap-2021/);

  - Robonomics DAO allocated up to 85,000 XRT for Q2 2021 - Q1 2022 community events that include:

    - [Liquidity providers incentive program](https://www.robonomics.events/#/liquidity);

    - [Academia support grants](https://robonomics.network/land/support-academia/);

    - Hackathons;

    - Crypto Community growth events.

  - “Parachain is live” public sale will offer 50,000 XRT. The sale will be structured as a [Dutch auction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutchauction.asp#:~:text=A%20Dutch%20auction%20is%20a,terms%20of%20quantity%20and%20price.); collected funds will go to Robonomics developers DAO Kusama treasury;

  - “Big Bag” private sales for smart-money investors, who will contribute to different aspects of the Robonomics growth.

### XRT inflation Q2 2021 - Q1 2022:

- Robonomics in Ethereum allows the mining of XRT tokens; core Robonomics developers expect around 100 XRT minted as a reward for liability contracts oracles;

- Robonomics Parachain XRT stakers will earn up to 120,000 XRT freshly minted tokens during Q2 2021 - Q1 2022;

- Parachain collators will participate in the distribution of 12,000 XRT for maintaining their nodes during the first year.

## Future

When Kusama & Ethereum bridges become stable & reliable, Robonomics Developers DAO will merge the tokenomics and enter the Interoperability era of Robonomics.

![fut](/blog/images/XRT-distribution/TotalAmount.png)

- Total circulation will increase by approximately 502,100 XRT, released by Robonomics developers DAO during Q2 2021 - Q1 2022. Thus, a new total expected XRT circulation is 1,770,596 XRT;

- After entering into the Interoperability era of Robonomics, developers DAO will start a Democracy burn event. During it, XRT token holders will decide the exact amount out of locked 7,000,000 XRT to be burned and offered on Interoperability Dutch auction;

- Core developers DAO treasury on Ethereum will have access to previously sealed 495,752 XRT;

- Robonomics Relay chain validators && collators will share the 1,000,000 XRT inflation as incentives;

- Robonomics developers DAO estimate that 10,000 XRT will be minted in Ethereum within 1st year after Ethereum 2.0 launch as a reward for liability contracts oracles.
