In the coming week, we will be holding lectures, practical exercises and have community discussions in Discord around one question: “How can we build IoT applications based on new Internet technologies?”

To get started, watch the welcome video:

And now let's move on to the first lesson, from which some members of our team had goosebumps...

## The first lesson of the Winter school: “Broadcasting through the black mirror”

![Robonomics Winter School 2022 Black mirror installation](/blog/images/online-winter-school-2022-lesson-1/blackmirror-installation.jpg)

The Robonomics app called [“Black Mirror Broadcast”](https://blackmirror.robonomics.network/#/) captures the spirit of dystopia as something of vital importance, floating around in the embodiment of QR codes, physiological tests for crossing international boundaries... life on a screen and in a box.

At such moments as a global pandemic, the truth, imperceptible in the daily life of big cities, is exposed. Technologies are already inexorably entering into our lives and very often technology becomes intertwined with our lives more deeply than some of us individually would like. Yes, there is a long-standing and difficult question from the field of philosophy about the opposition of the public and the private. But still, we want to implement and help grow Web3 in the field of IoT now at an early stage, so that it would not be possible to change the name of everyone on the planet to an identification code in an instant and without their consent. The new generation of Internet technologies will help improve the relationship between humans and machines, make smart devices more independent and faster in providing services to people, and importantly, not give control of one person over another with the help of machines. This is how we see the best scenario for integrating robots into humans’ daily lives.
