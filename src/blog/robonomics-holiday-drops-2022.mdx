In this experience you can remotely connect to a Boston Dynamics robot dog and mint a Holiday 2023 NFT card. Here's how it works:

<TextCard alignContent="left">
1.  Sign up: to participate, simply create an account using the Chrome extension, you’ll see the download link if you don’t have an account yet.
</TextCard>

<TextCard alignContent="left">
2.  Get your tickets: once you've signed up, you'll be able to get your Spot launch tickets. We give 5 free tickets to everyone who leaves their email.
</TextCard>

<TextCard alignContent="left">
3.  Draw something: use the box on our website to draw anything you'd like. It could be a holiday message, a snowman, or even a portrait of Spot itself! Simple forms work best for Spot’s skillset now.
</TextCard>

<TextCard alignContent="left">
4.  Watch Spot in action: our robot dog will then launch and repeat your drawing with its body while you watch it on the live stream. It's truly a sight to behold.
</TextCard>

5.  Get your NFT card: after completing the drawing, you'll receive your very own holiday NFT card with the art you’ve created on it.
</TextCard>

In addition to creating your art with the robodog, your 2023 Spot NFT also grants you access to the first lesson on Spot SDK in the Robonomics Academy!

The Robonomics Academy is a comprehensive learning platform where you can learn about the latest trends in IoT and robotics communication technologies and get hands-on experience with various hardware, including Boston Dynamics Spot. The Spot SDK is a set of tools and resources that allows developers to create custom projects for Spot. With your free lesson, you'll get a taste of what it's like to work with this powerful technology and see if it's something you're interested in pursuing further.

This is a great opportunity to see the most advanced robot in action and start learning to program it yourself. Do not miss!
