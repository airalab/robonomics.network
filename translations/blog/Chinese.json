  "Hey there! PaTara on the line. There was a recent event “Hack Johnny’s Lab” by Robonomics and I believe I did hack it in a way! Apart from the very first try which I lost due to rules misunderstanding, I won every round I took part in and here is a short “howto” story.": "嘿！PaTara在这里。最近有一个由Robonomics举办的活动“黑客约翰尼的实验室”，我相信我以某种方式黑进去了！除了第一次由于规则误解而输掉之外，我参加的每一轮我都赢了，这里是一个简短的“如何”故事。",
