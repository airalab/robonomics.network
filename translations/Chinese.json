The main criteria for the quality of the provider is security of operations, stability of connection and availability of the provider from anywhere in the world.": "数字孪生是物联网的核心",
  "Speaking of digital twins, it should be noted that architecturally their implementation is required; as a refusal to give the user direct access to control devices and change their states. Out of the most obvious reasons for rejection are, first, the presence of their own requirements and conditions in the devices just before the launch. Second, if multiple user devices must access a single data source, giving personalized control to each user can be critical. Lastly, it is extremely useful to keep the last actual state of the device available in case it goes out of operation.": "谈到数字孪生，需要注意的是，在架构上需要实施它们；拒绝给用户直接访问和更改设备状态的控制。拒绝的最明显原因之一是在启动之前设备中存在自己的要求和条件。其次，如果多个用户设备必须访问单个数据源，为每个用户提供个性化控制可能至关重要。最后，在设备停止运行时，保留设备的最后实际状态非常有用。",

It’s no longer just GPS location, shopping records, financial transactions and photos, but also a permanent record of video and conversations, voice prints, health conditions and even a list of a person’s habits. Among the types of threats related to privacy are: identification of information, localization and tracking, profiling, inventory attack, data linking attack.": "隐私问题需要与网络安全分开，因为这个问题特定于物联网系统。由于设备类型众多且多样化，这些设备比仅仅是计算机和智能手机更加融入物理世界，私人数据的类型范围也因此扩大。现在不仅仅是GPS位置、购物记录、金融交易和照片，还有视频和对话的永久记录、语音特征、健康状况甚至个人习惯清单。与隐私相关的威胁类型包括：信息识别、定位和追踪、个人画像、库存攻击、数据链接攻击。",
  "The creepiest part is that users have little or no awareness that they are giving up their privacy because they have almost no idea what data is being collected and how it is being used. The threat to privacy grows not only from intruders, but also from organizations and government agencies precisely because of this. The cloud IoT services typically require maximum data transfer from devices, and there are no ways to prohibit or narrow data transfer («Accept the Terms or Piss Off»). Moreover, despite the fact that the collected data is an asset and has real value, the person it is collected from is not only denied the right to actively dispose of that data, but even is denied any compensation for their own data’s collection and usage.": "最可怕的是，用户几乎没有意识到他们正在放弃隐私，因为他们几乎不知道正在收集哪些数据以及如何使用这些数据。对隐私的威胁不仅来自入侵者，还来自组织和政府机构，正是因为这个原因。云物联网服务通常需要从设备传输最大量的数据，而且没有办法禁止或限制数据传输（“接受条款或滚蛋”）。此外，尽管收集到的数据是一种资产并具有真实价值，但数据的主体不仅被剥夺了积极处理数据的权利，甚至连对自己的数据收集和使用都没有任何补偿。",

  "The Nobel laureate in economics Ronald Coase in his 1937 work “The Nature of the Firm” best demonstrated the dichotomy «hierarchy vs free market» and gave an explanation of the reasons for the existence of organizations, in particular firms. Coase discusses the impact of transaction costs (the cost of collecting and processing information) to make decisions about the conclusion of a contract and to monitor its implementation. The firm, with all its hierarchical extra-market structure, is formed as the most efficient way to provide the consumer with the target product with the lowest transaction costs at the moment, when the transactional effort to create the same product through multiple exchanges on the market between individuals becomes much higher. To best visualize this process, look at the illustrative example of buying a car. Try to buy a car by the parts and calculate how much money and time you will spend just to assemble all the components in your garage. The risks and negotiation costs of buying parts are too high compared to Tesla’s off-the-shelf Model X.": "诺贝尔经济学奖得主罗纳德·科斯在他1937年的作品《公司的本质》中最好地展示了“等级制度与自由市场”的二分法，并解释了组织存在的原因，特别是公司。科斯讨论了交易成本（收集和处理信息的成本）对于决策是否达成合同以及监督其执行的影响。公司以其所有的等级制度和市场外结构形式形成，是目前为消费者提供目标产品并以最低的交易成本的最有效方式，当通过市场上的多次交换来创建相同产品的交易努力变得更高时。为了更好地可视化这个过程，看看购买汽车的例子。试着按部件购买汽车，并计算你只是在车库里组装所有零件将花费多少时间和金钱。购买零件的风险和谈判成本与特斯拉现成的Model X相比太高了。",
  "Nevertheless, this does not lead to the emergence of the world’s only firm for the production of everything. The point is that the same transaction costs also impose restrictions on the size of firms. Coase writes:": "然而，这并不意味着世界上只有一个公司生产一切。关键在于同样的交易成本也对公司规模施加限制。科斯写道：",
  "“...a firm will tend to expand until the costs of organising an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction by means of an exchange on the open market...”": "“...公司会扩张，直到公司内部组织额外交易的成本等于通过公开市场进行相同交易的成本...”",
  "In other words, the more complex the hierarchy within the firm, the greater the internal costs, and at some point, they turn out to be excessive compared to the costs of returning to the market. Therefore, to ensure their growth as one of the drivers, entrepreneurs are looking for ways to reduce these costs.": "换句话说，公司内部等级结构越复杂，内部成本就越高，并且在某一点上，它们会超过返回市场的成本。因此，为了确保增长作为驱动力之一，企业家们正在寻找降低这些成本的方法。",

  "clearly correlates": "明显地与自动化解决方案制造商面临的问题和挑战相一致。在过去的50年中，大公司的大多数业务流程的标准/常规操作几乎完全自动化。制造基本上只需构建完全自动化供应链部分之间的安全通信，而这个任务是阻碍通过自动化进一步降低交易成本的因素。与部分自动化公司相比，希望市场上更具竞争力的产品或服务推动了对这些挑战的解决方案的寻求。似乎一切都在朝着机器人公司的出现发展——这些组织的整个业务流程周期完全自动化，不需要人类参与，除了作为受益者和消费者。",

Over the past 50 years, the standard/regular operations of most business processes of large companies have been almost completely automated.

However, is it ethical to live under tyranny in our future crypto-anarchist world, where everyone is expected to be responsible and enjoy freedom? Let's strive to create a more democratic society using smart contracts and the new generation of Internet technologies (often referred to as Web3). We need tools that can help us make decisions together, and then ensure they work properly without humans having to get directly involved.": "让我们想象一个由10-15人组成的小办公室。当每个人都专注于自己主要职业任务的截止日期时似乎没有人关心办公空间的维护。避免陷入混乱的最常见解决方案是雇佣第三方人员提供支持。另一种方法是采取主动行动，并对那些制造混乱或消耗物资而不补充它们的人施加惩罚。然而，在我们未来的加密无政府主义世界中，生活在专制统治下是否道德？在那里，每个人都应该负责并享受自由。让我们努力使用智能合约和新一代互联网技术（通常称为Web3）创建一个更民主的社会。我们需要能够帮助我们共同做出决策的工具，然后确保它们正常运行，而无需人类直接参与。",

  "Have you ever wondered why, in the process of evolution on Earth, the human species prevailed instead of, for example, fungi? Even now, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer to this question. The success of Homo sapiens is often attributed to successful cooperation, but then why not bees or ants?

Ultimately, the group where each member has the right to be independent prevails.": "您是否曾经想过为什么在地球上的进化过程中，人类物种取得了胜利，而不是例如真菌？即使现在，对于这个问题的确切答案仍然具有挑战性。人类智慧的成功通常归因于成功的合作，但是为什么不是蜜蜂或蚂蚁呢？我们的生存也归功于一个关键特征——个体在群体中的自治性。换句话说，不盲目服从蜂王的能力。最终，每个成员都有权利独立的群体取得了胜利。",
  "Unfortunately, those who proclaim themselves arbiters of human destinies rarely contemplate the true laws of nature. Politicians and major corporations engage in strategic games, where the populace is treated as mere units. This dynamic existed before the advent of computer games and has persisted since: 'buying units,' 'building units,' 'removing units'—throughout history, various ruling structures around the world have resorted to such dehumanizing terms when dealing with other people. However, almost invariably, to commit crimes against humanity, these rulers require enforcers, who, in turn, have their subordinates. Therefore, over the last 200 years, such stark dystopias in the vein of the book '1984' typically endure for no more than one or two generations.": "不幸的是，自称为人类命运仲裁者的人很少思考自然的真正规律。政治家和大公司参与战略游戏，将人民视为简单的单位。这种动态在计算机游戏出现之前就存在，并且一直持续至今：“购买单位”，“建造单位”，“移除单位”——在历史上，世界各地的各种统治结构在处理其他人时都采用了这种非人性化的术语。然而，几乎总是需要执行者才能犯下反人类罪行，而执行者又有他们的下属。因此，在过去的200年中，像《1984》这本书中的严酷反乌托邦通常只能持续一两代人。",
