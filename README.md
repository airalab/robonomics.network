### How to add a new post

2. Then, you need to add ***Frontmatter***:
 
It must be at the top of the Markdown file, and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. Between the triple-dashed lines, you can set or edit following options:

```

title: 'Introduction to Digital Twins' # Title for the page, you do not need to duplicate it in text
date: 2024-08-23 # Publishing date
published: true # the status of the post (if `false` it won't be visible)
locale: 'en' # locale in which the post was published
tags: ['Digital Twin', 'Web3', 'Philosophy of Robonomics'] # tags to use on blog and filter posts
cover_image: ./images/digital-twins-introduction/cover.png # cover image
description: "Digital twins are a powerful concept in modern technology. This guide will introduce you to the basics of digital twins, covering their history, types, current industry standards, and potential applications in web3. Whether you're new to the topic or looking to refresh your knowledge, this concise overview will provide valuable insights." # description of the post
abstract: "Digital twins are not a new concept; they emerged in the early 1990s and have since periodically captured the attention of researchers, engineers, and founders. Now, in 2024, digital twins are again in the spotlight—since 2016, according to Google Trends, interest in them has steadily grown. We believe it's important to familiarize readers with this concept, as the term is often interpreted loosely, making it challenging to understand.

3. Add contents of the post following markdown syntax.

### Components for post

#### Images 

- Create a folder with the same name as your post in `content/posts/images/url-of-your-post`. Upload images in the folder.

  - For localized posts:
      Create folder with the locale you are using in `content/posts/images/locale`. Then, create folder with the same name as your post in `content/posts/images/locale/url-of-your-post`. Upload images in the folder.

- There are two ways for inserting pictures in your post:

1. With the custom component `rb-image`.
It is recommended to insert pictures with built-in tag <rb-image>, however you may also use standard way for Markdown files.

```
  <rb-image zoom src="./images/digital-twins-introduction/2.png" alt="Physical asset's model" />
```

- localized

```
  <rb-image zoom src="../images/ru/digital-twins-introduction/1.png" alt="Классическая модель" /> 
```

2. Using markdown syntax:

```
  !["Robot Class Model"](./images/digital-twins-introduction/1.png)
```

- localized

```
  !["Классическая модель"](../images/ru/digital-twins-introduction/1.png) 
```

- Inserting localized post covers 

If you need to localize your cover than your *cover_image* will look something like this: 

```
  cover_image: ../images/ru/digital-twins-introduction/cover.png
```
