[Cyber Academy](https://cyberacademy.dev/) is hosting an event in Tbilisi, Georgia, where participants will be able to get acquainted with the Polkadot ecosystem, starting from the very basics: a detailed discussion of all the components of Polkadot, networking in an informal atmosphere and developer workshops.

Engineers from the Robonomics team, Pavel Tarasov and Makar Chernyaev, will talk about the use of Web3 technologies in the context of a Smart Home, as well as demonstrate how to operate a smart light bulb using HomeAssistant, etc.

During the report, Pavel will talk about the traditional ways which users interact with Smart Home devices, the role of the device vendor in these operations, as well as show examples of open source solutions for Smart Home local networks. He will also consider the shortcomings of the conventional smart home approach and outline the methodology of the Robonomics team and our plans to solve the existing issues via the use of distributed technologies.

As part of the practical demonstration, Makar will illustrate the main ideas of organizing a Smart Home/Office with real examples of using Web3 technologies in this area:


1. Remote control of Smart Home devices using transactions on Robonomics parachain on Kusama. Controlling a smart light bulb that streams to YouTube.
2. Installing a local smart home system and demonstrating the operation of this system. Registration, access control. Deploying a Home Assistant OS image with Robonomics enabled.
3. Reading telemetry from sensors outside the local network at home. Receiving data from the sensor when the user is in another local network through messages on the Robonomics Kusama parachain.

At the master class, participants will see how HomeAssistant works by operating a smart light bulb and reading telemetry through a demo in the Robonomics dApp.
