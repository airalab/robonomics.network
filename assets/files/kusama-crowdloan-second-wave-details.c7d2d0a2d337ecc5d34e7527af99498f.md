This is great news indeed! There were many concerns that the successful connection of the first 5 parachains would shift the focus of the entire community and developers to replicating already tried mechanisms in the Polkadot network. But no! Not long after, and you can see how the Kusama network is deciding to hold a second wave of auctions. The Robonomics team is pleased with this news, and we will try to get into the list of projects that can say with confidence they are part of the Polkadot ecosystem in September.

Below you will find the final parameters of the second crowdloan of the Robonomics company, and the answers to the most interesting questions that we, as the project developers, have tried to proactively highlight.

## From the past to the present

During the first auctions of the Kusama network, Robonomics published a crowdloan module for the start of the 3rd auction. It was necessary to try to guess the sufficient fundraising limit. As a result, it was decided to set a collection limit of 135,000 KSM. If you look at the results of auctions from the 3rd to the 5th, then the limit was chosen, we can say with pinpoint accuracy:

Also, as can be seen from the statistics of the last Robonomics crowdloan company, about ~ 27,000 KSM were collected in total. Among the projects that participated in the first wave of auctions, such a volume allowed the project to be on the 7th line, i.e. become the second project among those who did not receive a slot in the first wave. In general, we are confident that the second wave of auctions should be successful not only for the Kusama chain, but also for us personally. In general, in order to successfully pass the second wave of auctions, we want to do the main thing - not to change the conditions of participation…

## Roadmap for the development of the Robonomics parachain in the Kusama network Q3 - Q4 2021

Today, the Robonomics parachain is undergoing a process of further development and testing inside an up-to-date copy of Kusama, supported by the developers, called Frontier Network. By mid-September, we will have to finish checking the functionality of the update 1.1 Staking and 1.2 Treasury and Technical committee updates of the [Frontier network](/blog/robonomics-frontier/), which in turn will significantly reduce the time to implement these updates after the launch in Kusama. Also, all balances of parachain users in the Frontier network will be transferred to the Robonomics parachain managed by Kusama ASAP.

Thus, the updated roadmap for the development of the Robonomics parachain for the period of slot leasing will look like this:

<Card>

### Part 1: Establishing core functionality

In 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.

* **Genesis state: (0 week)** Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.
* **Update 1.1** Staking and allowing transfers (0 - 1 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for all token holders and 50% for Crowdloan participants.
* **Update 1.2** Treasury and Technical committee (2 - 3 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.
* **Update 1.3** RWS (4 - 5 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.
* **Update 1.4** Robot-as-a-service (6 - 7 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.
* **Update 1.5** XCMP functionality and Robobank (8 - 9 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.
* **Update 1.6** Democracy and Remove Sudo (10 - 11 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.

</Card>

### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D

2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.

* **Globally available digital passports of products**. By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.
* **Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics**. We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries. The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.
* **Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits**. It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.
* **Fault-tolerant civil sensors network**. A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.
* **Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas**. It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.
* **Ecosystem integration updates**. We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.

### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain

The final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain. This is our vision of the future of Robonomics, as a complete segment of the Polkadot infrastructure specifically prepared for working with IoT devices.

</Card>

## In conclusion

Kusama is an experimental network, and the main thing for which it is worth participating in any activity around this network is the desire to be involved in a large experiment. When deciding whether you will help Robonomics during the second crowdloan company or not, the only significant question for you should be - do I want to see the functionality of connecting IoT devices from the real world under the control of the Kusama network in the near future? If you answer is yes, then you are as crazy as we are - you want to turn the world around, which means you are welcome on board!
