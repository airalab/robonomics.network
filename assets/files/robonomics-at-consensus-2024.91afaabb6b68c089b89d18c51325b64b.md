Win 500 DOT for 1st place and the latest Razer laptop for 2nd at the Coindesk Consensus Hackathon! And Raspberry Pi 5s to install your self-hosted smart home for top-3 winners.

Join us for a unique and exciting track focused on using Robonomics for smart home and robotics use cases. We offer remote access to two cutting-edge labs:

- **Boston Dynamics Spot Lab:** Work with the renowned Boston Dynamics Spot, a quadrupedal robot known for its agility and maneuverability. Explore how to control Spot using web3 tools, create decentralized applications (dApps) for Spot, or use Spot's data to develop innovative services.
- **Smart Home Lab:** At present, Polkadot is one of the largest DAOs in the world! There are many interesting events taking place in the ecosystem as part of the on-chain governance experiment. Robonomics developers suggest that hackathon participants increase Polkadot community immersion by integrating events related to voting, new treasury requests, epoch changes, and much more, into a typical smart home system.

With our track, you'll have the opportunity to:

- Explore the potential of blockchain technology in the smart home and robotics industries
- Gain hands-on experience working with cutting-edge robotics and smart home equipment
- Collaborate with a global community of developers, engineers, and enthusiasts
- Win exciting prizes and recognition for your innovative projects: A top-of-the-line Razer laptop, smart home equipment, and 500 DOT cash prize!

**Boston Dynamic Spot Lab Description**

Here are the instructions to work with Spot: <https://merklebot.notion.site/Docs-for-RoboHackathon-b057d24828194c78bac53a3885305382?pvs=4>

The SDK is relatively straightforward and we offer an easy-to-use platform to deploy your code to the robots directly.

The robot has a microphone, speaker, and camera so you can build use cases utilizing that equipment. For example, issuing an NFT certificate based on the sound or video data captured by the robot; or exploring ideas of how you can pay the robot to perform certain tasks, like going somewhere and inspecting a part of our lab.

**Smart Home Lab Description**

In the Robonomics wiki, we have prepared a guide with an example of launching an autonomous agent. This agent allows you to link on-chain gov events with smart devices, such as a light bulb. The instruction is available at the link: <https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/on-chain-gov-experiment/>

At the initial stage of the hackathon, a mentor from Robonomics will provide anyone interested with access to the demo stand of a standard smart apartment. This stand will be available online 24/7. On this stand, developers can test their solutions and record real demonstrations of their code for the final presentation.

[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/k9G2WQWcmj) to start looking for teammates and discuss your ideas with the team. We are excited to see what youâ€™ll build at Consensus this year and our team will be there to support you!
