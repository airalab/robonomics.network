Becoming one of Kusama's parachains is a good way to provide access to your Substrate project within the Polkadot ecosystem, implement currently unavailable Blockchain network security to small projects, as well as initiate the integration process with other ecosystem projects as soon as possible. The goal of Robonomics for 2022 is to become a fully functioning conductor of IoT projects to the Polkadot ecosystem. This is why all of the aforementioned benefits of launching a Kusama network are important to us. And in general, our strategy has [already been published](/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/) a long time ago - \"Kusama first, while Polkadot is a vision\". In this post, we’ll dissect the use of the Cowdloan module in detail and take a look at the parachain update plan after launching. \n\n## Kusama crowdloans have started!\n\n*Dr. Gavin Wood, June 8, 2021, [Kusama Parachain Auctions](https://polkadot.network/kusama-parachain-auctions/):*\n\n> The following is the case assuming that no significant and unexpected issues are found with the relay-chain logic. (In such a case, all options should remain on the table for network governance, including pausing or postponing any scheduled or ongoing auctions.)\n\n**Preliminary schedule of auctions:**\n\n- 2021/06/15, 12:00 GMT: First Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences. Bids may be placed.\n\n- 2021/06/22, 12:00 GMT: Second Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/06/29, 12:00 GMT: Third Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/07/06, 12:00 GMT: Fourth Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/07/13, 12:00 GMT: Fifth Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\nPolkadot allows parachains to source tokens for their parachain bids in a decentralized [crowdloan](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crowdloans). Once a crowdloan campaign is open, anyone can participate by sending a special transaction that references the campaign's index. Tokens used to participate must be transferable — that is, not locked for any reason, including staking, vesting, and governance — because they will be moved into a module-controlled account that was generated uniquely for this campaign.\n\nFour projects who launched their KSM crowdloan campaigns (Kurara up to 1,5 mln KSM, Shiden up to 1 mln KSM, Crust up to 1 mln KSM, Moonriver up to 1 mln KSM)  to collect resources for leasing the parachain slot on Kusama during the parachain lease offering auctions. \n\nRobonomics Dev DAO aims to bid an exact amount of KSM needed for securing a third-fifth parachain slot. Thus, the crowdloan module will be launched right after the end of the auction for 2nd slot on Kusama.\n\n## Estimated time of the Robonomics crowdloan launch is 28 June\n\nYou’ll be able to participate in the Robonomics crowdloan through the [dedicated page](/kusama-slot).\n\n**Before participating in the crowdloan, double-check that the campaign is live [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).**\n\n## How to participate in the Robonomics Crowdloan \n\nBy default, Polkadot developers provided a native interface in the [Substrate portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan)\n\n![Crowdloan on Polkadot portal](./images/kusama-crowdloan-details/crowdloan-on-polkadot-portal.png)\n*Example of the Crowdloan page on June 11th, 2021*\n\nAt the start of April, Robonomics practised participating in auctions by using the Crowdloan module on the Rococo network. You can check out this Twitter thread to familiarize yourself with the standard interface for community participation in [Polkadot auctions](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1377653645827833860)\n\nAlso, it’s worth mentioning that on the official [Robonomics site](/kusama-slot), functionality for interacting with the Crowdloan module will be made available.\n\n![How to participate in Robonomics Crowdloan on Kusama](./images/kusama-crowdloan-details/crowdloan2.gif)\nThis is what Crowdloan participation will look like on the Robonomics site after June 28th. \n\nInstructions on how to use the Crowdloan interface module through the Robonomics website will be published closer to the start of the third auction. \n\n## Popular questions amongst the community\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Why does Robonomics participation start only from the third round?\n\nDevelopers could publish the Crowdloan module today, but then we would have to implement limits. As can be noticed, the first 4 projects that published their Crowdloan modules established a 1 million KSM token limit. \n\nWe’re placing our bets on 100,000 KSM being enough to win one of the Kusama network auctions, but are also reserving space for ourselves to quickly adjust the limit if we come to understand that more KSM tokens will need to be collected by the conclusion of the first and second rounds. In general, we’re trying to manoeuvre in search of an optimal rental cost for a slot.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### What will happen if Robonomics doesn’t win the 5th auction? \n\nTo be honest, we don’t have a plan B. [We'll be like Schwarzenegger](https://youtu.be/Ri-M_Vo3w5A).\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Will it be possible to participate in the Robonomics crowdloan through exchanges? \n\nSome well-known exchanges like Kraken and Okex are already providing crowdloan support for their users. A list of relevant exchanges that support interaction with the Crowdloan module will be provided on the Robonomics website at the start of the 3rd auction.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### What will happen in 48?\n\nIf after 48 weeks the project will once again be unsuccessful in winning an auction, then the parachain will turn into a [parathread](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parathreads#docsNav). However, developers have already published preparation plans for future slot auctions: here’s a publication from October 26th, 2020, [Robonomics Parachain Lease Offering, On-chain Governance Strategy](/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/). But, we also have a secret plan concerning the development of an algorithm to be built into the Robonomics protocol, which will autonomously generate beneficial bonding terms for KSM/DOT holders that will also benefit Robonomics. In general, we contemplate over medium-term issues in advance and continue to think about important matters such as maintaining Robobomics in the state of a parachain today.\n\n</Card>\n\n## Life after auctions\n\nA parachain comes to life inseparably from the moment auction results are concluded. But for a project, this doesn’t indicate that work is over. Remember how the Polkadot Relay Chain launched? The Robonomics team is contemplating over an analogous launch form, increasing functionality accessible to a user in steps. \n\n## Robonomics will start its existence with the following possibilities: \n\n- XRT transfers between balances\n\n- Launch of IoT devices using XRT for paying transaction fees \n\n- Sending IoT device telemetry using XRT for paying transaction fees \n\n- Sudo\n\n- A technical committee\n\n## Further update plan\n\n- Genesis state: Core functionality (0 week). Launch of the above set of functions.\n\n- Update 0.1: Staking (1 - 3 week). Will allow you to stake your XRT with a 10% APY for token holders and 125% for Crowdloan participants. \n\n- Update 0.2: Treasury (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. \n\n- Update 0.3: RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments but a monthly subscription as well. \n\n- Update 0.4: Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices. \n\n- Update 0.5: Robobank (11 - 12 week). You can read about Robonomics in this article:\nhttps://robonomics.network/blog/robobank-introduction/ \n\n- Update 0.6: Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee. \n\n- Ecosystem integration updates (before the end of the year). Further, we will focus attention on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in what Polkadot can do. \n\nStay tuned and follow our updates [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics)\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.62c183a.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.9ea8d39.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.6b2ed88.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.62c183a.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-7a089b301d1ba104aa2078919dfee8ba'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-7a089b301d1ba104aa2078919dfee8ba)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUCAwYH/8QALxAAAgIBAwEHAgUFAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABSESBhMiMUFRcQcUFTJhkaGBkrHB0f/EABkBAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGAgMEAP/EACoRAAEDAgQEBwEBAAAAAAAAAAECAxEABBIhMUEFE3HwBiJRYYGRocHR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDEQV4pKsrtIwlUqQqgEBc4JYn%2bAM6ruxRQWpI4J1sRKcCVRgNxqq5NBUjV5omkDOECowDEn2JB%2bPI/B1XbFpNxh6ak0VOXIZ5kKxo3TkKjEAs3B4P7DTsviqGbsNqUYVsY3jTcxB%2bzrlWVHDS5bqemMHoJn9megI9YqeD7abV9jndI5JiEVsEp5tjQe20LO4Qd5XjkdhjrRIJZChPoelTz66fxRbtFWji%2bztzPnHeCvOCB/aPn340TXeNpMYqBXSH8A5PfSk12iIbE4LGML1FVZTkkH8v6f60A6MjFXUqw8wRgjTtKe6XIla1Qtwu%2bfFNXnYjj36efL%2bdLLtG5UryTW4pIVGQhlhlXvCBnAJXGTqSbxomMWfelWNIcCfP31oUjnzOibVC1USN7MMkQf8vXwT6%2bXnqW0Vd4v/cNsdeaYJCe/wC7QHpU%2bec/H8aUTWbTESTSSMWGAz85x%2bp1ILUXSmRA98/rb9rRhGGc5/K652U7J2fwala3GnGtS0VtrYOCzKMgIpByrcgjy9fPSmnYil7SNt1WFtygMrRVYpj1ksVwABwMZz6Z/X108%2bm/aiXdaY7N3qytDBWYRzxuUcIMDHz4vzDGtNt3ZXZNuu171CpJFagkVkdpmfnPng6Q%2bI267W9dvruClI8oA0AznXX6rc1cuBg2zTh8%2bvz8bVzWXcN/%2bn%2b7W9tiKVpxMk7K6LJyFPQQfhiPbU63bve5ZO7laoDKAvNZQGHoB7as%2brO4S7n2wtzT9IaNFqjpHsgYN85bWc2eGvYuH7xHesis7xxuELLkZUMQcDy9Doq3fWNyyi5WwFKUATIG4HXvemGx8JXl6wXebgRsdSfeBA16Vp9x7eb7AxqJNXbuy%2bFFdT055Yn9s6Sbv2s3feqiVbksJhjl79VjgVfH09OT/Q6I3OpVvSz260Ipws5RII2JCL1dJ8R5JOMk%2bpzpd9jGNzaDqboUDkAA%2bI/4GdXWjvDyoAsJSroP8rrrwveWTXODuNKczsR/DHselANuN6vFKsE7Rd7w5i8HUPY4xnSlkklcFizgccn01p7u2xRnpDufB1c49/jQW40EpRxNG7N3hOQccYx/3R9htlvJtIE%2bgpXuVqUZKpr/2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Kusama Parachain Lease Offering, April 2021","path":"/blog/kusama-parachain-auction/","date":"April 17, 2021","description":"Robonomics rewards the Kusama Parachain auction participants!","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\nimport Button from '~/components/Button.vue'\n\n<div class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## 1 KSM = 1 XRT\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"text_abstract layout layout__text animate post_abstract in-viewport animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\nEvery participant will be rewarded with XRT\n\n</div>\n\n> The most relevant information is available here: https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot\n\n- Get rewards: per 1 KSM contributed, 1 XRT is rewarded\n- XRT for now is available on Uniswap, Huobi, and in addition on PancakeSwap\n- Receive increased staking of 125% return for the next 48 weeks\n- Quick rewards option: 25% right after the win, 75% after the successful launch of the Robonomics parachain (est. 2-4 weeks)\n- Contribute to the future: Robonomics integrates new technologies into the real economy \n\nCrowdloan limit: 100,000 KSM\n\nRobonomics will participate in 3rd-5th slot auctions to win.

For example, it allows Polkadot users to [pay vending machines or robots in any token of the Polkadot ecosystem](https://robonomics.network/blog/robobank-introduction/).\n\nRobonomics is a project with a long history that started in 2015, after the launch of the Ethereum network. During the project’s development, the team published more than [10 academic articles](https://robonomics.network/community#science) and created more than [15 R&D projects](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/r-and-d-based-on-robonomics-network/) which included control of drones, industrial manipulators, sensor networks, and even a Boston Dynamics’ robot dog over Ethereum and Polkadot networks.\n\nRobonomics is a project that integrates new technologies into the real economy. However, to fuel this, a reasonable ‘gas’ price is required. Kusama makes the costs of communication between IoT devices and humans affordable.\n\nKusama Auction mechanics: [https://kusama.network/auctions](https://kusama.network/auctions)\n\nParachain Crowdloans: [https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/mirror-learn-crowdloans](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/mirror-learn-crowdloans)\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n![\"Robomomics Parachain on Kusama wallpaper\"](./images/Kusama-Parachain-auction/wallpaper_KUSAMA_6.jpg)\n\n</section>\n\n**Community, support our auction** 🦾\n\nRobonomics Developers DAO\n\nStay tuned: [https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics)\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.62c183a.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":676},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.9ea8d39.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 480w","/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.6b2ed88.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.62c183a.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 676' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-147d193177a363b1cc489fc0649b0a75'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-147d193177a363b1cc489fc0649b0a75)' width='1500' height='676' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2blXIqGSLODIpBIIBwDzxnU9v%2bwUG7tlXG03cyJTVCeuEZdGVgylQRyfMBx79tVv4U%2bHdr2BUXu81F3rL/dGolibqU3TEcDYYIFyc5wMnOAB7c6EuFcNdyi7oaS7mytu4Xqmoyg/KUuvnHTwR5fnOnUVUlRRJUU5yj4IJH38a4%2bzu252kkiFPTLTBYWkpX6kZ49I4HK/XsRrr6aBLfQJDDysYxlvfJ5Op0vrhORGxwMsdP73rfhNflZTS3qunJYBgpzk9uNCrEyup7DGONJgvUQscMM4Ge%2bkrkyuuB%2bONU0hZZgJEXHJzz8aYXusNrtdbXqvUMUfnCE4Bx96kCASCRyO2hqIY6iF4p0WSJxhlYZBH3rWEBwLhssNabKrJPFGsUqBZEKN/t1Wxj54XTGo8U5Up2hFko2ixjpiR8EfGOnjVnNtuyt6rXRH%2bYRrW21LA3qs1vP8wL%2btVNRIHwvX7SGsjDlypHbfif8A43b5aW32SIRSztMRJUyElm74xH2OMj6OlW/1CXGm6hbaatEneT%2b7YKR88pq6js7bZ72K2H/mT9aBtkbXYYbb1qI%2b6VP1o2zXZ45gnzPyjwxLlbNlXltzbWtF7eEU7VkAmMKt5gufbPGdTSsDI64wRjn50FFSU9DSRUtFDHBTRL5Y4o1Cqo%2bAB2GtoABJA5PfUmIWlxLRQWTAv//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Robobank.

This approach saves us from the fear of being in a cool but empty sandbox.\n\nThe presence of the Robonomics parachain will allow other Polkadot parachains to expand the functionality of native tokens by adding instead of the full and rather complex functionality of working with IoT devices to your virtual machine (i.e runtime), functions such as: pay for launching an IoT device or receive data from the device during the payment process.\n\nNext, we will look at an example of architecture using multiple Polkadot parachains in order to extend the capabilities of any project through infrastructure integration solutions based on XCMP.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## Robobank Architecture\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n![\"Robobank from Robonomics introduction, infographics\"](./images/robobank-introduction/robobank-introduction-infographics.png)\n\n</section>\n\nConsider an example of a truly decentralized Uber service.\n\nBy implementing Uber Parachain, developers could focus on the rating system of drivers, the system for processing user requests in p2p mode, and other customer service issues, and not worry about the need to simultaneously support the IoT component of their applications — Robonomics will help with IoT. Uber Parachain will only need to integrate the Robobank pallet into its runtime in order to provide customer access to the car after payment and receive trip reports directly from the IoT modules of the car.\n\n### Let's have a look at the diagram above and highlight the important points:\n\n* **Polkadot token** is a native parachain token, implemented for example through the assets pallet.\n* **Robonomics Web Services** is a pallet inside the Robonomics parachain, which implements the ability to connect an IoT device under the control of the Polkadot network on a monthly subscription model with guaranteed bandwidth.\n* **IoT app** is a custom application for automating the ordering of services, in which the native parachain token is used for payment. In the example with Uber Parachain, it would be a familiar phone application for city residents to order a taxi or search for a carsharing service.\n* **The car icon** is an IoT device acting as a party to an automated service, partially or completely providing a service. In the example, it would be a car, and by no means a driver! It is the car that would be the party providing access to opening the car doors and generating a trip report with telemetry data.\n* **Robobank Branch** is the Robonomics module for inclusion in the Polkadot parachain network.\n* **Robobank Tower** is the Robonomics module that runs permanently in the runtime of the Robonomics parachain and can launch IoT devices with an active subscription based on token transfer transactions in neighboring parachains.\n\nAs you can see from the diagram and the description of the modules, the parachains need to install Robobank Branch, which can be performed in the parachain [update mode](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-protocol-info#runtime-upgrades) without a hard fork.\n\nNow let's look at a step-by-step use case to represent the full cycle of the Robobank module after the Robobank Branch is enabled by the Polkadot parachain.\n\n1. `PaymentToRobot()` — this function can be seen among others in the parachain after the Robobank Branch module is enabled. As a result of a user sending a transaction from an IoT application, Robobank Branch will receive data on the amount of the payment and the device that needs to be launched for execution.\n2. `TransferToRobobank()` – will ensure the transfer of funds from the user account to the Robobank account with the ability to withdraw the accumulated amount in one transaction from the IoT device. For example, after making 10 trips or working within 5 hours, the car can generate automatic transactions to transfer funds from the Robobank account to the address of the crypto exchange. There is no actual movement of tokens from one parachain to another.\n3. `SignalToRobonomics()` — will be a function using XCMP. It is important to note that we will be able to ensure that messages sent on behalf of Robobank Branch are identified and marked as trusted. Some analogue of communication between smart contracts in the Ethereum network.\n4. `SignalFromRobonomicsBranch()`  — the message sent in the previous step will be sent through the Relay chain for processing to the central node of the Robobank Tower module. Having received a message from the parachain, Robobank Tower will record the request to launch the payment device in the Robonomics parachain, and thereby remove the need to store the payment log on the side of each parachain who uses the Robobank Branch module. In fact, the Robobank branches will perform the functions of correspondent accounts and are subordinate to the main branch in the form of a Tower, in which the full history of the execution of the automated service with payment in the neighboring parachain will be kept.\n5. `FreeTXtoRWS()` — two modules of the Robonomics parachain can trust each other, just like smart contracts in Ethereum. If we can ensure trust in the request from Robobank Branch to Robobank Tower, then in the same way we can provide the ability to launch a device with an active subscription not from the device address, but based on payment in tokens.\n6. `Launch || Datalog` — a combination of these functions will allow, for example, to launch a service for execution with an indication of the user who will have access to the back door of the car in the Uber Parachain application, or record the data necessary for the provision of the service.\n7. Steps 7-10 implement the possibility described in step 2. `TransferToRobobank()` to periodically empty your IoT device account by sending a transaction in the Robonomics parachain directly to Robobank Tower.\n\nAs a result, we examined the architecture of a solution using cross-chain transactions to expand the capabilities of a separate project at the expense of a common ecosystem.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## Current status and plans\n\n</section>\n\nAfter the first tests on the Rococo network, the developers will publish instructions for the implementation and use of the Rocobank module on the [wiki.robonomics.network](https://wiki.robonomics.network/)\n\nOur main goal is to prepare the Robobank module for the launch of parachains on the Kusama network in the summer of 2021.\n\nTo find out more, stay in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.62c183a.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.9ea8d39.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.6b2ed88.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.62c183a.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-cfe40197b020caf02faed6579c04cd73'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-cfe40197b020caf02faed6579c04cd73)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2b53ZmrUbtGwohs1/1iqx8WJVkP0HP8H%2bsXEJZI4HYBF/avf7VNA1peL%2bndDncboS50TbqrNahu0rQJhsxKVyVxlWU8EZB5OhDVud0LG89ablTqw1KNClVYiGJryOXkcJli3ocEYHwNzg6qezC9ezLBKAJInKNj6Dg6lgNoNnb4rXv8csuSucRh5wtK16fS0%2bNa0K1%2bzxpKrPnwVmwMnAz61c/ZrpXbd66QtXr1etLNFeaEGSukhx%2bNW5YH6fWg3uTJZ6f7p7s23WGgsVpk8JoAIjn8aHOFwBpKKkGNBKpIeN194yVIGdSfTm3jc96pbfI4jWaUR%2bSxhjk8AeuScDPAzn9tdu47/u3VW4VZN/3CzcPmsSiRyQoJ/YcakOttuWsqX45pBI74VFAVUBJOBgD7/WoGuIqBkuvKPdQfUFBNu3KSrCfJQikq4QtGxXJQsvolT6yP8ORqNVSDgD3o07a7XU3OHeJLsX5WrpCY8njyYg/5rvqdM1X7l7pti/jEFMWCqmPyUlIxg%2bOfpzj3xrO2ZrpTFuO3VI6MtjxNv3oq84049jPI%2b6Mk2WrBuvSU4UMu4WUE0TDKepVHHwg%2bxqe7s7dtUdi5apUBVnkWGziN8IofAKhQAP509wmvoha4OFQv//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"XRT token distribution Q2 2021 - Q1 2022","path":"/blog/xrt-distribution/","date":"March 18, 2021","description":"Article provides a deep dive into the XRT distribution plan","content":"\n[![HowToGIF](./images/distribution-plan2021/XRTdisthowto.gif)](https://robonomics.network/community#token)\n\n*Updated XRT distribution plan available at [https://robonomics.network/community#token](https://robonomics.network/community#token)*\n\n## Introduction\n\n[The previous Distribution Plan](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZjzJbZDhs7B3YhtRkvdg4jp6qpfkVGB67w7vH2nJBUrE/Robonomics_token_Polkadot_KUSAMA_stage_details_september_2020.pdf) was released by Robonomics developers DAO back in September 2020.

Decentralized infrastructure services over IPFS, Ethereum, and Polkadot for Robotics and IoT. For industrial, consumer, and commercial solutions","content":"\n**Robonomics Web Services (RWS)** is decentralized infrastructure services over IPFS, Ethereum, and Polkadot for Robotics and IoT. For industrial, consumer, and commercial solutions.\n\n## Meet the first RWS IoT Core services\nRWS is a state-of-the-art infrastructure that you will love. RWS lets connect devices easily and interact with user applications, cloud services, and other devices securely. No single point of failure, open-source, most interesting internet tech on a turn-key basis, and your freedom to use it in any place in the world. Truly global network for Robotics and IoT devices.\n\nThe first RWS IoT Core services over Robonomics Parachain:\n\n* **RWS: PubSub Message Broker.** Use unlimited messaging over a p2p network based on IPFS protocol.\n* **RWS: Data Blockchainization Service.** Put data into IPFS and store hashes in a public Blockchain.\n* **RWS: Robot Actions.** Switch on / off; launch or stop your IoT devices under control of decentralized computer.\n\n## Let’s begin subscription model experiment with RWS token\nThe main token of Robonomics network is XRT. This is utility token which your robotics / IoT devices can use to pay transactions fee to interact over Ethereum today. Soon, XRT will give your robotics systems the same opportunity in the Polkadot ecosystem with Robonomics Parachain.\n\nFor engineers, Core Dev team will try to make different Robonomics usage models and the first step in this way is launching lifetime subscription token — RWS token. As Tesla promoted their roadster with lifetime charging, so we want to promote Robonomics network with lifetime subscription offer for the first. Become a robot economy pioneers!\n\n> ### 1 RWS token will give you 1 transaction per second (tps) from/to your IoT device over Robonomics Parachain.\n>\n> Just activate your RWS token and make more than 2,500,000 tx in a month with no time limits. Deactivate RWS token and trade it on Uniswap any time you want.\n\n**Example case 1:** You own 0.1 RWS token and want to share telemetry with shadow in Public blockchain every 10 seconds. You need to activate it with transaction to special address of ethereum mainnet smart contract. After that, you can use RWS: Data Blockchainization Service each 10 seconds (1 RWS token == 1 tps, 0.1 RWS token == 1 tx / 10 sec).\n\n**Example case 2:** You own 2 RWS token and want to control automatic car wash under Robonomics control. You need to activate it with transaction to special address of ethereum mainnet smart contract. After that, you can use RWS: Data Blockchainization Service and RWS: Robot Actions each second in parallel mode.\n\n**Current status of RWS token:** initial distribution stage.\n\n**Total supply:** 100 RWS tokens which will present lifetime using of 100 tps Robonomics Parachain bandwidth.\n\n**Distribution plans:**\n* 50 RWS tokens will be distributed via [Uniswap XRT/RWS pair](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x42018a2ff89b6d662b5f746277bd02f0d85f485a).\n* 50 RWS tokens will be reserved for academia and non-profit organizations.\n\n**Expected time to launch RWS token functions:**\n* alpha version — Q3 2020\n* beta version — Q4 2020\n\n**Further emission of RWS.** Benchmarks of Polkadot Parachains indicate that 100 tps is a small part of potential bandwidth of Robonomics Parachain. At the same time, Core Dev team want to make different types of subscriptions. From our perspective, RWS token is pioneers’ especial offer. And in future, we will focus on other types of RWS tokens with monthly and other types of limitations of using Robonomics Web Services for Robotics and IoT devices.\n\n## Conclusion\nRobonomics Web Services is the new branch of evolution in Robonomics project. Earlier, we only said we have Software platform, Decentralized network Providers, and some use cases based on our technologies. From now on Robonomics project made step on the way to bring something at least as good as Amazon Web Services but on the top of new internet technologies wave. It still R&D and experimental, but pioneers who would like to be the first in new fields are welcome! More Services in RWS IoT Core and not only in core will be presented this summer. Alpha version will start as soon as possible.\n\nStay tuned and [follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/logo.62c183a.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/logo.9ea8d39.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg 480w","/assets/static/logo.6b2ed88.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg 1024w","/assets/static/logo.62c183a.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-f7bafff053f16303429b9f1d635e7c6b'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-f7bafff053f16303429b9f1d635e7c6b)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAwEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEBQMACP/EACkQAAIBBAICAQQBBQAAAAAAAAECAwAEESEFEhMxQRQiUWEVM3GBkaH/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/xAAaEQADAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARECITFB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwD6ppe%2bWYYOqalZlUFj8DJ1QE/HT3FxbeS7tfpZO7L4/IH%2b0MQGyPyMHHxmqJM%2bNuuM4OM1ksYuctLa9seQmitcF1aIFe%2bxs5wcaIwR81qLIsvkVc/bokjWxn/Pugk4GHPhTtjt1GcHI9UXZgpKr2P4zil7rGYozkltDA1of8rJ5GSy4rh7%2b%2b5e/mXj1zPJK7sPEo/BXeP1Qq96bK5xsYNGsfjo7SC6t/oluHjnh7rI0zuvU7GmJ/X73WxQ1vKy%2bHqBJBGBqjSyossTxvtWBU/2NDBFyjcir2X8alqytcKLnzsQViwclMe2zjR1R5ia7j4q7k4mGO4vljLQxM2A7Y0M0eP422sLG2tLZGENvuMO5cj38nZ9mqiAiMVUDXwKuXI2iaVTRPxs08vHW0t/D9NcugMkRYHo2NjIJH%2bjRaM3UdzDdxxNA2UADduykfII1XcAPGvcA6zsfqp77j7e8s7i2nQmGf8AqBWKk%2bvkbHoU%2bh2cKUAVQAMKBgCmrnDEkMEcSZCIoVcnJwPW66VAj//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"The ultimate guide to Robonomics, RWS and Robonomics parachain on Polkadot","path":"/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/","date":"February 25, 2021","description":"This article delves into the connection between Robonomics platform, its parachain on the Polkadot ecosystem and the Robonomics Web Services (RWS)","content":"\nTaking into account the never-ending discussions on the backbone operation of Robonomics, let’s investigate the under the hood structure and outline the main pillars of the network.

Instead, you have to carry out a [chain of actions](https://blog.aira.life/simple-iot-scheme-990224363803) that will eventually lead to a connected IoT device and interconnected elements of the infrastructure, enabling the signal from the device to reach you.\n\n## The chronology of the Robonomics Network development\n\nSo how did the idea to create the [Robonomics parachain](https://parachain.robonomics.network/#/explorer) and [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/land/say-hello-to-robonomics/) came about? Originally, back in 2015–2017, we started with the development of a quite complicated solution we called the [Economy of Robots](https://blog.aira.life/the-first-in-the-economy-of-robots-6f4bb115643b). We are confident it is exactly what smart cities, industry 4.0 and the development of the IoT apps will come to.\n\nOur primary goal was to create software for cyber-physical systems that can manage autonomous and independent devices within the technical and economic transactions framework. Therefore, we decided to generate a technical and economy biased transaction and make it serve as a foundation for the development of more complicated processes.\n\nOne of my favourite scenarios of the Economy of Robots is called [Smart Building Offsetting](https://new.dapp.ipci.io/#/offsetting). It is a service that allows an autonomous building to collect and aggregate information on its energy consumption and then communicate it to another agent within the Robonomics Network, and even request carbon footprint offset services. In turn, the agent verifies the location of the building, works out an applicable coefficient of CO2 emissions and then synchronizes this data with a partner project [DAO IPCI](http://ipci.io/), to determine the number of carbon credits from the green finance market that are required to offset the building’s carbon footprint. These operations were successfully executed on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n### The solution to the problem\n\nToday, the Economy of Robots that we managed to build back in 2017 with our colleagues and partners, comprises a complicated at first glance chain, that acts as a final turn of the IoT industry evolution. The biggest issue we had was that we were amassing all the knowledge and realised our ideas, without having a chance to pass them on to anyone. Every new [scenario of the Economy of Robots](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/r-and-d-based-on-robonomics-network/), created during the development of Robonomics Network platform, was making the end product that little bit more complicated to understand for people foreign to the matter. In other words, one must be acquainted with multiple competencies and spend years to grasp the thinking behind intersecting disciplines that form the concepts of economy and machines working together.\n\nWhen you start to understand the nuances behind the development of an IoT application, it quickly becomes apparent that technical specialists must spend years to reach a fully functioning product stage. This is why we decided to turn potential users of our platform into co-developers. We focused on teaching them to become professional IT engineers in the IoT application space and as a result, we created Robonomics parachain and Robonomics Web Services.\n\n![DAO IPCI with Robonomics network](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-network.jpg)\n\n\n## Introduction to Robonomics Web Services\n\nIt is clear that the Economy of Robots is interesting to the public. Nevertheless, the main problem is that after a short while these users still flock to Amazon Web Services for IoT devices and start using that instead, without figuring out the critical advantages that the Robonomics Network carries compared to the renowned IT giants. This brought us to the conclusion that we cannot be about promises of completing something in the future without providing a real product here and now.\n\nTherefore, we decided that a range of real services must be provided to our potential users. Services similar to what other cloud platforms are offering but better. As a result, we created Robonomics Web Services, a product built on our in-house protocols and platform that uses an open-source robotics framework (ROS). We then dedicated 2 years to the development of the key functions that I will now delve into in greater detail.\n\n### The key functions of RWS:\n\n**1. Subscription**\n\nThe standard approach to blockchain services always includes transaction costs known as transaction fees or transaction gas. This means that when you make a transaction, its priority is dependent on the cost or fee that you are ready to pay for it. The higher the fee you pay, the faster your transaction will be processed. Such a model is not suitable for systems that rely on guaranteed bandwidth. You have to be absolutely sure that your device will be able to make a transaction at the set time and a predictable cost. This is something we don’t see often today, as transaction costs are fully dependent on the fluctuation of the exchange rates, at times reaching $50 in cost.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we have created a Subscription service, which is an alternative cost model on the Robonomics parachain for Polkadot. It guarantees execution of a prepaid number of transactions and assigns them a higher priority compared to transactions that are paid through fee model. To learn more about the difference between monthly Subscription and XRT tokens you can revert to my ‘[Heterogeneous tokenomics](https://blog.aira.life/rws-overview-part-2-heterogeneous-tokenomics-afc209cc855)’ article, whilst my other piece planned to be released at the end of December will outline the final architecture and interconnection of the two models.\n\nOur Subscription model does not only solve the guaranteed transitioning problem but also only costs $10 per device, making it an extremely profitable offering for the end-user. Moreover, it provides a stable bandwidth for thousands of monthly transactions, which is quite a stellar achievement.\n\n**2. Launch**\n\nLaunch is a very simple but economical function from the usage of computing power and blockchain point of view. It allows you to turn on or off your device and change its binary setting from 1 to 0 and back by sending a request to it in the form of a transaction. Since there isn’t much complexity attached to this function, let’s move to the next critical pillar.\n\n**3. Datalog**\n\nThis function works with telemetry and therefore requires me to expand on it. It works in two modes where you either save your IPFS hashes or store data on the chain.\n\nSo how do you use these modes? The on-chain datalog function is applicable when your data size is below four variables. There is simply no point in saving a chunk of data this small on IPFS (off chain), as bytes wise this on-chain log won’t be incrementally larger than the IPFS hash. We suggest recording the entire raw data inflow as a single function or opting for the IPFS hash. Then, Robonomics as a platform for developers will process the recorded data, be it raw or in form of an IPFS hash and decide where to write it to. This datalog processing will be hidden from the end-user and he/she won’t even notice the difference between two different types of storage.\n\n‘Liability’ is our final function but it won’t be released to the public until we know the goals that large scale Economy of Robots projects pursue. Another milestone product for us that we are working on is aimed at [Robot as a Service](https://blog.aira.life/what-is-robonomics-network-robot-as-a-service-and-future-parachain-of-polkadot-or-something-more-36deece9f3cb) framework, or as we call it, the ‘contractually obliged robot’ on Ethereum. [This infrastructure](https://blog.aira.life/robots-under-robonomics-control-overview-39337ac9fbbb) has already been described in full detail in our knowledge hub and implies a situation where the end-user uses our service tokens without relying on XRT or other tokens to pay for parachain usage.\n\n![The key functions of Robonomics Web Services (RWS)](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-rws.jpg)\n\n## What is the connection between RWS and the Economy of Robots?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the goals behind Robonomics Web Services is to educate our users and turn them into co-developers who understand the Economy of Robots. We believe that there is nothing complicated about this task as long as the user gets acquainted with the basic functionality discussed above.\n\n### Digital Twins\n\nNext step in applying the instruments provided by Robonomics Web Services is to learn how to create a Digital Twin, otherwise known as a Digital Shadow for the app. It acts as a digital version of the real-world equipment and copies all of its technical characteristics.\n\nWhat does this mean I hear you ask! Let’s take an intricate structure of sensors that measure the air quality as an example. You cannot make them do measurements every 5 seconds because their internal calibration and balancing of measured data takes 2 minutes. This is where a Digital Twin comes in, allowing us to make an app that is responsive to the user’s commands.\n\nAccording to the [Gartner report on IoT market trends](https://www.gartner.com/en/innovation-strategy/trends/iot-adoption-trends), 85% of the companies that were part of the study have already implemented or plan to implement Digital Twins over the course of the next year. Most of these companies have in-house engineering teams that work on proprietary solutions. Nevertheless, they all acknowledge that they have to rely on already existing solutions to be able to scale quickly and keep their services adaptable to the constantly changing IoT industry environment.\n\nThis is why our parachain on the Robonomics Network doesn’t only offer the aforementioned functions that are not available on Ethereum IPFS, but also allows our users to create Digital Twins of their devices.\n\nWe are developing this feature to let users build their own Digital Twins, interpret them on web services/IoT apps and most importantly save them as a model that will write the datalog. Our [Wiki](http://wiki.robonomics.network/) is being constantly updated with all the required knowledge to execute the aforementioned solutions and will soon be complete with basic information that explains a Digital Twin build from A to Z.\n\n### Applying Digital Twins\n\nOnce the data processing model is finalised and your Digital Twin is fully structured, you have to decide what will be its relation to the web service or an IoT application.\n\nAnalytics is often the common choice for such digital service, where a sensor sends you the data it measures (updates its digital copy). This data will most likely be subject to post-processing since it is highly unlikely that you are interested in the Pascals pressure value inside of your country house heating system. Instead, you need to know whether the temperature in the house is right and whether the heating system is still on. You basically have to decide how to apply the digital twin of the data that you saved on it and this is where additional services can help.\n\nNow, we shift to a complex scenario of Smart Building Offsetting, where a copy of energy consumption data acts as a digital twin. Let’s say that you want to save energy consumption data for a given flat and use the Datalog function with IPFS storage for it. If you are looking to find out the total amount of consumed energy, you would save it on-chain. Opposingly, imagine that we run a digital twin of the smart building. The Offsetting Service will frequently ask this digital twin to provide various data on energy consumption, then store it and after performing off chain calculations, connect/talk to Robonomics in order to provide required services.\n\nWe gathered such services in a specialised [marketplace](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services) that acts as an App Store for robots.\n\n![Decentrilized application, dapp in Robonomics network](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-dapp.jpg)\n\n## Understanding the Marketplace\nIn order to implement a model of interconnected digital twins and services, we must create a delivery medium for it or in other words an app on your smartphone. This marketplace, built on a decentralised ledger in face of decentralised applications, can be used to duplicate and create individual copies and digital twins for any required purpose out there via predefined templates. Most importantly, this is done without intermediaries and external storage, making our IoT services marketplace censor and centralized link free.\n\nLast but not least, let’s talk about the user interface. We strive to always offer our users most up to date online technologies and therefore grant access to decentralized applications. The greatest feature you get during the development of your Dapp, is the lack of vulnerabilities on your side. Whilst your app is on IPFS, it is connected to the ENS registry or the Polkadot ecosystem registry and hence the user is not faced with the vulnerability of dealing with a substituted app or a request when following the hyperlink. It is simply very convenient from the point of view of end-user application development and its maintenance.\n\nAnother advantage of decentralised applications is peer-to-peer communication. In other words, your app can communicate to its digital twin, the IoT service and the end-user application without a single point of signal decline, eliminating the need for third parties and intermediary resources when a task needs to be executed. This is what the [robonomics.js](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-js) is for, used in the development of [Dapp Robonomics](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/). We are currently in the process of adding a new iteration of improvements and will soon release a Robonomics Stylebook (an interface guide based on web3.js and polkadot.js functions), leaving you with an easy job of structuring your application right. As a result, we complete the full Economy of Robots chain.\n\n![Robonomics Network](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-network-2.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n* Our goal is to make [robots part of the economy](https://blog.aira.life/the-first-in-the-economy-of-robots-6f4bb115643b) but first, we need to teach the user on how everything works and set up.\n* To aid the purpose, we have created the [Robonomics Web Services](https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-web-services-and-rws-token-intro-d730ab50ad42) product that allows users to build apps and services together with us (subscription, launch, datalog).\n* Subscription to RWS resolves all transaction-related issues and adds functions that include: turning device on/off, telemetry (storage of a digital twin).\n* Once you create a digital twin via in-house templates, you can develop an IoT service and add it to our [marketplace](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services). The pre-structured interfaces in Dapp are used as a delivery mechanism that take your service to the end-user.\n* [Dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/) serves as a bulletproof way to establish a peer-to-peer (direct) communication with a digital twin, even when the service stops to operate. Regardless of the external circumstances, the market will never fail to work.\n* The aforementioned chain is a pathway to the Economy of Robots described in this article.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robonomics-logo.62c183a.55ad49b8c05f517a00fbc467115a9fba.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robonomics-logo.9ea8d39.55ad49b8c05f517a00fbc467115a9fba.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robonomics-logo.6b2ed88.55ad49b8c05f517a00fbc467115a9fba.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robonomics-logo.62c183a.55ad49b8c05f517a00fbc467115a9fba.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-1d10d0008b2a6602f9116a9a3c42b698'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-1d10d0008b2a6602f9116a9a3c42b698)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgABAQEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAABwYEAwIFCP/EAC8QAAEEAQMDAwIEBwAAAAAAAAECAwQRBQAGIQcSMRNBURQiCCOBsTNhcXKRweH/xAAZAQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBAIFBgH/xAAnEQACAQMCAwkAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADESESMRNBgQQFFBUiI1Fxkf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AKNp4HHTWxNyWRiONoDhVjGnloludqTXbTahyar/WsEjHsv7gabZhzsXjpDqUNibZWgULtZSkE%2bfb3Gvc9Mdr7m3HlnV7ReVGkRQA6%2biR6KkIXY4I5N0eBrX1UwW8NvSYTO858ibGccWqKXJhdBqu4gHlJII04rAPnM44JQgYM67u27tyFtWNkcJPKp7bwZkR1u9xUDdKAIB4oeONSUJdrSB765BD2UoRGnVKbIv1Hgav4utaIkHIxlpdbYKXEHuCg4jj9L%2bdGaope%2b31AIjLTC5JA579ZV4lQbWQtYQpJIKFAhXGkTbclNp50TsLyMh/1pKS4%2b4ui4t1FrIHN88nxzqywOQcgqR9SgD1E/b9wP7aLTcRWvTNto97fWlTKDQPNKPxqgjSkKUUA%2bNGe2ssVNJQjuVQugL1URZoQSoggfzFaI6A85VVUbFhCf8ADdFVDxeRyMSaC7JcDDzKU0WQjlJs%2be7uJ48AfOuv4jo31%2bFgz500JMJ70mWlJJLxcruFgcUE3/n3rRTsbdk3asXKuwrWVpbptSgEd3dXcRVnjjyPOvHfG8p%2b64ON%2btHphouEoSr7Cq%2bFAVYNGvJ1jj3f2/zXxWv2trXO1vja9%2bfW15s%2bLS4Gi3qkzOTj/p1egr832vvP7itJHRXpJE6i4TIz5OVfgriyhHCW2kqCgUBV2ffnRK%2baBOlNO9nuleExmNwbD6nZzImynxLW2HHFJFUkDihx59tXTuEIQnJi2lmUuBgTd1m6RxOnO14eXi5eTNVIlJj%2bm80lAAKVKvj%2b3RzgckoLJSqwAD8atI2/XuqjyNsbhjP%2bg4FOMPCYtRYdAISsJIo1ZFe4PtouiJVFnPMBfd6a1NlVV3Ua8fpqVGuBU0HNpB6TNT17Xx%2bWn0X0jzqhueLHDLzyX21tlaDQb4u1cHjjSNkXmUOZNTjxZSZKPuASrn0uBwAefk/90Y9EO5nD5bIsntktOMsBXetJ7V%2bR9qh8aqtw5V%2bY9nWnwCpqe19wUqv4VUASa8X/AFvTOXqRR1Cpif/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Trajectory of Robonomics Development 2021, Part 1","path":"/blog/roadmap-2021/","date":"February 18, 2021","description":"The Polkadot architecture is becoming explicit and complete, which should allow us, as parachain developers, to shift our focus from maintaining improvements in Polkadot dependencies (the substrate framework, cumulus and other), and move on to increasing the functionality of our parachain.","content":"\nStarting with this article, I would like to share the tasks that the core project development team are ready to share with the community today.\n\nIn total, we have counted about [20 tasks](https://github.com/orgs/airalab/projects/7) that we are willing to implement this year. Some of them are full-fledged tasks, while the second part rather reflects the fact that the core developers devote time to this area, for example, supporting the academic community, conducting dev camps and developing Internet resources around the project.\n\nToday I will share the development team plans related to task #1 - launching parachain on the Kusama network.\n\n## Task #1: Parachain on Kusama\nLeads: [@ensrationis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0c53yygAAAAJ&hl=en), [@akru](https://github.com/akru)\n\n![\"Robonomics Parachain on Kusama first\"](./images/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/Robonomics_Parachain-web.jpg)\n\nEarlier, we presented a general vision of development in the Polkadot ecosystem - [Robonomics Parachain on Kusama first, Robonomics Relay Chain on Polkadot is a vision](https://robonomics.network/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/). Now let's add more details.\n\n### Rococo > Kusama > Polkadot \n\nOn December 31, 2020, [the Robonomics release \"Rococo V1 support\"](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v0.22.0) for testing the parachain in the main Polkadot testnet Rococo v1 was published. During January - February 2021, we continue to improve the Robonomics code merging new commits associated with the restarts of Rococo Relay Chain. To test the operation of the Robonomics parachain, the developers keep our own fork of Rococo Relay Chain up to date, so the issue of connecting our parachain to the public network is rather a question of (1) public proof of the project's compatibility with the ecosystem, (2) the possibility of conducting tests with other projects from the ecosystem - Phala, Acala, Moonbeam, Darwinia etc - to search for collaborative implementations using the now available XCMP in Rococo v1.\n\n### Kusama Slot Auction\n\nAhead of us are tasks related to participation in the auction of slots of the Kusama network. First, we need to figure out the implementation of this mechanism. Of course, we have been studying the theory for a long time, but the practice of participating in the auction will open up new tasks for the team. In any case, we will try to rehearse the auction and share the results with the community through a blog post.\n\n### Democracy, Treasury and others parachains modules\n\nIn addition to participating in the auction, the developers are in the discussion of the following issues regarding the launch of the parachain on the Kusama network:\n\n* What modules from the standard and used in the Polkadot / Kusama network can be useful to developers and the community after the launch of the parachain?\n* How are we going to launch parachain: follow the scenario from root privileges for the main developers to democracy, or …\n* How many XRT tokens should be transferred from Ethereum to Kusama and then to Polkadot?\n* The minimum inflation parameters in the Robonomics network for the successful launch of the staking mechanism at the start of the parachain.\n* …\n\nOf course, there are more questions, but these ones will most likely be interesting for the community in the first place and we think about them as a priority.\n\n### Specific Functions of Robonomics Parachain\n\nWhile speaking about the launch of the parachain, we must understand its main and special functions, which open up new possibilities of the Polkadot network to a certain group of users. Robonomics will provide the ability to manage smart devices connected to the Internet using the Robonomics Web Services (short: RWS) functionality, and we will also implement the functionality already tested on the Ethereum network for the emerging robot economy - smart contracts for the provision of automated services. Thus, Robonomics aims to help the entire Polkadot ecosystem increase the capabilities of each project separately towards deep integration with the IoT market.\n\nTo date, the possibility has already been implemented (1) to enable, disable and transfer the IoT task to the device / robot through the Robonomics parachain; (2) to receive device telemetry directly through the parachain or in a combination of IPFS + parachain for big data, and (3) a parachain subscription mechanism with guaranteed bandwidth.\n\nAhead of us is the implementation of such functionality as:\n \n1. Robobank to accept any Polkadot token in automation services\n2. Single version of True via Digital Twins on Blockchain\n3. Bitcoin payments for real estate\n4. Privacy of using IoT applications\n5. global supply chains on blockchain\n6. DeFi connectivity for IoT\n7. NFT for IoT\n\nAs you can see, tasks such as (3), (4), (6), (7) are of particular interest, since they imply integration with other parachains in order to utilize their useful functions in Robonomics.\n\nLet us see the power of a common ecosystem of many specific projects!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Polkadot architecture is becoming explicit and complete, which should allow us, as parachain developers, to shift our focus from maintaining improvements in Polkadot dependencies (the substrate framework, cumulus and other), and move on to increasing the functionality of our parachain.\n\nIt is important not to forget that the process of racing for a parachain slot is an internal development process, but most importantly - a specific functionality of a parachain; the main thing is to provide Robonomics functions to other parachains and implement the use of other parachains in your code. Then the entire ecosystem will be able to provide interesting functionality to users; functionality that will be extremely difficult to find outside of Polkadot.\n\nIn the next article I will talk about the Robobank project, the improvements of the Substrate based client of the Robonomics Network, as well as our plans for the development of Robonomics dapp and Robonomics Web Services.\n\n*ensrationis*","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/1.62c183a.0b4ff580eb7c82adac28c73dc00bebfe.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":676},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/1.9ea8d39.0b4ff580eb7c82adac28c73dc00bebfe.jpg 480w","/assets/static/1.6b2ed88.0b4ff580eb7c82adac28c73dc00bebfe.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/1.62c183a.0b4ff580eb7c82adac28c73dc00bebfe.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 676' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-8fbe7e00c0d4ea6195db06caeca378d8'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-8fbe7e00c0d4ea6195db06caeca378d8)' width='1500' height='676' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwUEBgcCCP/EAC4QAAIBAwMDAgQGAwAAAAAAAAECAwQFEQASIQYxQRNRBxQVkTJCYXGBsTOh8P/EABkBAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIEBQMAAf/EAC8RAAEDAwICBgsAAAAAAAAAAAECAxEAITEEQVLRBQYTUYGREhQVQmFyobHB8PH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/APS96uEtDCrU8IlKspk3HaFQnBOTgZ/c6Fc6%2bK2n6lX3GGmtix8h8YJ8EHz%2bw01lRJIysqqyHuGGRql9U2SxXK2XKtrMXOSjikZEM%2bVg2jO1VXhew7gn3zrxtClOROcCmGuxMF6QkZIEnl%2b7066T6ih6mopq2jp546NZTHFLKAPWA7sB3AzxzpxUu8cEjRRtJIFJVFIBY%2bBzxrH6L4qzQWumeCz2yGn27UjFZs24z%2bUJx20tu/xSdKSaumsVulXhmVLqwduwB27c%2bf71Z9ha8mEoGeIc6RVr9G6slslKdrEn6xW5U7tJCjSI0bkDcp7g%2b3GiawVfi3NSTzTR2S0B0yXZrye5z2BTn%2bB5GhXT4/1lvp/WexWyVT2EV03E9vHp/r/etEdW%2bklmA2J%2bZPOiLzXumfCtNqrnXXTqGpoKO7JaoYJTTRBYFlkqJVjEjk7uFUKw/U886cdK3GqrqSqhuIjNbQ1LUszxDCSEAEMB4yrDjwc6qc0d1vstsv8Ab0looxazVH5WOOSSWWULmNd%2bBuCqBuI9tXPp6301stwp6UyMd5eZ5X3yPI3LFz5bn/hqO4goJSciq%2boUz6un0YkgWGQd5MbiLXudoil/VV9ht0M8cET1FwjhMiRBDgg57tggZwdVfoaoonuUsNDR0xp6ripEdKUGcA48g9%2b386tdR0zHNcaysFdVh6llYq21hGVGBsyOMc/c6mWCyU1kp5IqVpGDkMxkOSSFC5%2bwH20Sg0Egpurv7rXqQ2t6SlVknnag/SbP816Js1EMj8XyyYP%2btQL5Z7HTiJ3Sz0KqSWEtLCTJx2G7GDot5ramovX0uCZqaJYRPJLH/kcE4Cg/l7cnk88Y1GFkpUwYIoUPlniErMfcs2Sfvoe3c4j50%2b3o2gAXbTew/P8AakWyydO1cO%2bGitFWNq5KU0Jwcc/hHnXVVY%2bm4EcfSLIs20sqSU8S59vHbURrJSEs7oiy91lgQQupxjIZMHzo1jnaquldbLgsdU9IkbrUSRruZXydpGMcY7%2bfbRDUO8R8zXOaREFTRkDP28c/Cup4aj6Qai1JGlZFGEengkXYQvIQeB3/AE4OPbSro6%2btcbsII1mgR09ZvViVC5KqwGBnJKsCT441dREqIyRBUyD2XjP7ag2Ky09nWVaUsVl2bi7MzZVdvdieMAYHYazCiAQN6VIBua//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Parachain Lease Offering","path":"/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/","date":"October 26, 2020","description":"Robonomics developers aim to allocate $720,000 for a 2-year lease of a slot in the Kusama network.

This underlying amount of XRT will be distributed among the KSM holders who will support the project with their tokens at the upcoming auction of Polkadot’s wild cousin.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that this offer will be 1.5 times more profitable compared to KSM staking. Moreover, during the period of the next 2 years, we will be preparing for the Polkadot slot auction that is expected to be set within the $ 3.2-6.4 million price range.\n\nBelow you will find the calculations and explanation of our chosen strategy with regards to the Kusama auction in 2020 and the Polkadot auction in 2022.\n\n![\"Robonomics Parachain on Kusama first\"](./images/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/Robonomics_Parachain-web.jpg)\n## Robonomics Parachain on Kusama first\n\nAs the Polkadot ecosystem makes its first steps, we understand that our goals must take into account not only the network’s final architecture, but also all important milestones in the future development of the network. We, the Robonomics developers team, believe that Kusama will serve as the primary pillar of Polkadot development in the upcoming 2 years, and hence, it is the Kusama network that we would like to concentrate all our efforts on.\n\n> “Kusama first” is our development strategy in the Polkadot ecosystem for the next 2 years.\n\nAccording to preliminary estimates, one slot of the Kusama network is enough to service up to 10,000 [digital twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin) of IoT devices at once with a subscription price of less than $10 per month. This will allow Robonomics to debug the process of connecting IoT systems during the lease of the Kusama slot. Next, we will be ready to scale the network to 1 million IoT systems connected in real-time by transforming the Robonomics network from Kusama Parachain to Polkadot Relay Chain.\n\n![\"Robonomics Relay Chain on Polkadot is the vision\"](./images/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/Robonomics_Relay_Chain-web.jpg)\n## Robonomics Relay Chain on Polkadot is the vision\n\nBy the time the Polkadot network is technically ready to accept 100 parachain projects, and the Kusama network is successfully connected as a parachain in the Polkadot slot, Robonomics will be ready to introduce its own parachain of parachains to multiply the bandwidth. Based on our estimates, the Robonomics Relay Chain will allow the Polkadot network to serve up to 1 million IoT systems simultaneously with a subscription price of $2.\n\n## Initial Parachain Offering and Robonomics Parachain Lease Offering\nWe recommend reading the following articles before continuing: [Obtaining a Parachain Slot on Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/obtaining-a-parachain-slot-on-polkadot/) and [Polkadot Parachain Slots](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-parachain-slots/).\n\nOur goal in this article is to outline a fair price for the Robonomics Parachain Lease Offering in 2020 based on the following factors:\n* Existing parameters of the launched Kusama and Polkadot networks;\n* The forecast of Parity developers and the Web3 Foundation team;\n* Community expectations versus current DOT and KSM staking rates.\n\nThe capitalization of the Kusama and Polkadot networks is estimated at $300 million and $4 billion respectively. At the moment, both networks have identical parameters: 10% inflation, 50% as target stake in the Relay chain and 100 parachains as the target number of projects in shared security. Given this data, we can estimate the 2-year slot lease in the Kusama network at $480,000, and $3,200,000 in the Polkadot network.\n\n> You can find our in-depth calculations here: [Robonomics Parachain strategy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LkKYNzwNABv6SQfCkZwRi99XW47xg6eR1-tdtp5CQIQ/).\n\nNow, let’s try to sequentially perform a follow-up calculation in the table below:\n\n### Step 1: Calculating the size of the KSM and DOT market available for auctions\n\nLet’s consider that the number of KSM and DOT within an ideal stake will always be blocked by the community. Then, we subtract it from the most realistic amount of cryptocurrency in constant circulation and presume that the trading volume equals to 10% of the total token circulation.\n\n| Total KSM: 10,000,000  | Total DOT: 1,000,000,000 |\n| - | - |\n| - 50% ideal stake ( -5,000,000 KSM)  | - 50% ideal stake ( -500,000,000 DOT)  |\n| - 10% trade balance ( -1,000,000 KSM)  | - 10% trade balance ( -100,000,000 DOT)  |\n| ** 4,000,000 KSM ** | ** 400,000,000 DOT ** |\n\n4,000,000 KSM and 400,000,000 DOT - the size of the available cryptocurrency for bonding to parachains.\n\n> Please note, that due to inflation, the total number of tokens will experience a year on year increase, but to simplify calculations, we do not take into account the increase in total supply. Moreover, we believe that the growth rate itself will not be significant enough in the first couple of years.\n\n### Step 2: Estimating the expected return on the staking of KSM and DOT\n\nThe current inflation rate of 10% per year can be revised next year using the on-chain governance function, but we assume that this indicator will not be revised in the next 1.5-2 years. This means that the holders of KSM and DOT tokens can expect the return from the IPO of Polkadot projects to be at the level of 20% per annum. Resultantly, we can now calculate the expected return:\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Kusama shared security cost</th>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Polkadot shared security cost</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Target bond, KSM</td>\n            <td>4,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Target bond, DOT</td>\n            <td>400,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n         <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, $</td>\n            <td>$48,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>$640,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\nAs you can see, with the current capitalization of the Kusama and Polkadot networks, the parachains should in total, generate KSM and DOT token holders, a return of about $50,000,000 and $650,000,000 respectively every 2 years.\n\n> ** Compound or simple interest in the calculation? **\n\n> We do not believe that the formula of compound interest of staking reward accumulation is worth using and is applicable at this time. Robonomics and other parachains will offer DOT and KSM blocking schemes, where the reward will be accumulated either in full at the beginning of the slot lease, or in part during the entire lease period, whilst the funds themselves will be transferred to the address of the holder without restricting access to them. This means that making calculations based on simple interest is more realistic and more convenient.\n\n### Step 3: Estimating the cost of shared security for one parachain slot\nPolkadot developers are aiming to set 100 parachains with 1,000 validators within the Kusama and Polkadot Relay chains. Therefore, in our calculations, the Robonomics developers propose to take into account the target division of the shared security cost. This, in turn, means that the expected return from blocking KSM and DOT tokens is divided into 100 projects in our calculations.\n\nIn this case, we arrive to almost the same indicators of the network security annual costs, as mentioned in the article [Polkadot Parachain Slots](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-parachain-slots/) (~$200,000 per year). Of course, this relates only to the Kusama network, since the cost of Polkadot shared security is already high today ($3,200,000 per year). Nevertheless, given the transition of Robonomics to the Relay Chain state, we will be able to afford these security expenses and thereby provide the IoT market with the most secure globally accessible network in the world, the protection of which is already estimated at $4 billion.\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Kusama shared security cost</th>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Polkadot shared security cost</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Target bond, KSM</td>\n            <td>4,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Target bond, DOT</td>\n            <td>400,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, $</td>\n            <td>$48,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>$640,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parachains, total</td>\n            <td>100</td>\n            <td>Parachains, total</td>\n            <td>100</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Shared security cost annual per parachain</td>\n            <td>$240,000.00</td>\n            <td>Shared security cost annual per parachain</td>\n            <td>$3,200,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Lease period, month</td>\n            <td>24</td>\n            <td>Lease period, month</td>\n            <td>24</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected reward per parachain</td>\n            <td>$480,000.00</td>\n            <td>Expected reward per parachain</td>\n            <td>$6,400,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n## On-Chain Governance Strategy\n\nThe beginning of the Robonomics’ parachain existence will be supported with funds allocated by the developers’ DAO. In the future, we plan that commissions from the monthly subscription activations for digital twins of IoT systems will be accumulated on the On-Chain Treasury account (minus the commission of the collators and the further development fund). Funds from the treasury will be governed by the parachain technical committee for participation in the subsequent auctions of Kusama and Polkadot slots. Potentially, funds in the form of a 2-year commission should be sufficient enough to extend the slot lease after Robonomics transitions to the Relay Chain state.\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Robonomics Parachain on Kusama</th>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Robonomics Relay chain on Polkadot</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>tps</td>\n            <td>1,500.00</td>\n            <td>tps</td>\n            <td>300,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>block time</td>\n            <td>6</td>\n            <td>block time</td>\n            <td>4</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>IoT Monthly subscriptions, max</td>\n            <td>9,000.00</td>\n            <td>IoT Monthly subscriptions, max</td>\n            <td>1,200,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Subscription price</td>\n            <td>$10.00</td>\n            <td>Subscription price</td>\n            <td>$2.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>2 years leasing slot total commissions</td>\n            <td>$2,160,000.00</td>\n            <td>2 years leasing slot total commissions</td>\n            <td>$57,600,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, %</td>\n            <td>2%</td>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, %</td>\n            <td>2%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, total</td>\n            <td>$43,200.00</td>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, total</td>\n            <td>$1,152,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Treasury</td>\n            <td>$2,116,800.00</td>\n            <td>Treasury</td>\n            <td>$56,448,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td></td>\n            <td></td>\n            <td>Robonomics Relay chain validators incentive</td>\n            <td>$15,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\nCommission rates for collators will be determined by the democracy module, as well as inflation rates after the launch of the Robonomics Relay Chain.\n\n## Ecosystem strategy\n\nRobonomics is set to provide IoT devices with access to the Polkadot ecosystem, whilst Robonomics Parachains will store digital twins of these IoT devices. Within the parachain itself, users will be offered similar and even equivalent functions that are currently offered by other existing IoT cloud platforms such as AWS IoT, Azure IoT. In addition to standard IoT market functions implementations, for example, remote device launch and telemetry capture, Robonomics will be able to integrate with other projects in the eco-environment as they appear.\n\nWe believe that within 2 years, the list of available Polkadot ecosystem opportunities for the IoT market will be as follows:\n* Storage and management of cyber-physical systems’ digital twins in the Robonomics parachain;\n* Money for robots: integration of the most popular cryptocurrencies and tokens from the Polkadot ecosystem through XCMP;\n* Smart contracts for robots: access to smart contracts using a bridge to Ethereum and support for EVM in parachains such as Plasm, Moonbeam, Edgeware;\n* NFT identity for mobile robotics through projects such as Acala and Distributed Sky whitepaper;\n* Tokenization of data from IoT devices for the environmental liability market based on DAO IPCI;\n* A managed access to IoT systems using DAO for collective management of public, corporate and private spaces;\n* Robotics Smart leasing and bond issue for the installation of robots in smart cities with distribution in the DeFi market.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nRobonomics is an infrastructure project for the Polkadot network, which aims to place more than 1 million digital twins of IoT devices with a level of security and global availability that the cloud platforms operated by IT corporations cannot provide. Robonomics developers will provide integration for these digital twins with ecosystem projects and thereby open access to previously inaccessible tools for automation systems of city living, logistics and production, namely, direct access to fintech solutions without banks.\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-cover-web.62c183a.0a239770c06887970e47fe72652c3f12.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-cover-web.9ea8d39.0a239770c06887970e47fe72652c3f12.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-cover-web.6b2ed88.0a239770c06887970e47fe72652c3f12.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-cover-web.62c183a.0a239770c06887970e47fe72652c3f12.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-3c9ebd43c9b3aeb43553232bcaa42135'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-3c9ebd43c9b3aeb43553232bcaa42135)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAQQDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAABBgcCAwgF/8QALBAAAQMDAgUCBgMAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFEQYSEyExQVEHYQgUInGBkSQyQv/EABgBAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBAMB/8QAIxEAAQQCAgEFAQAAAAAAAAAAAgABAxEEIRJBMQVRweHw8f/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A6ppA%2b9I0qELB11tptTjq0obSMqUo4AHkmvHs2poF5lTWrcXHWooG%2bRjDRJ7A9T%2bsVWnrhrK2abnRYOoo14nx5Lanmm4K22m28Hb9RUcqV3GeXtUNtnr9pKLZja29M3NuKtBQ6lDzKeJkYJJC85I96dgd60t3fHGF92fXTN8v%2b8ropdxSmREaS044JAyHEDKU8vNFOPtN7eI4hG9WxO5QG5Xge9UBbviC05Dt7UODZLsxHbQG208ZlRQB05qUT%2b6kPp1r63avcmwbZZJRMBXzbIecQQhaiQkf35/6PYfmgojZ7rXupxIXbztXDg%2bR%2bqcZ7mhoMn5lokoW04nAWhWMpOM45feiBSLqemNOaWKEKJ620HZdZhsXlL54aChJaXtOCc%2bDUBm%2bjOh4rqg/e7s27gpLfz6AcY6Y2VYsuS9crpNhqdWzFiFCVJaVtU6VDPNQ5gDwOvemTb0NpCYSkxUgYw22mm5lVWqo8UB2b7ff7%2bKvoHpDouSUtsXy6qexzaE9BUM%2b2ytts0FadA3d1NglSUiUyOMh98LWQCcdAMDmfv8Aip4qAl0/y1pkpxja42nkfIOM0BKtsZ2422HPSuZBW4eGy8snhqAyDnqpPLoc9evao/UYZcvGKAD48u1tHFGB8x3XX39IrRkt12VOYdkNuJG1aE5%2bsDpz7kcutSugLPaYdnjKj25ngsqWV7ASQknxnoPaj6MLHLGgCEy5OLVajmNjNyZqtf/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}}]}}},"context":{}}
