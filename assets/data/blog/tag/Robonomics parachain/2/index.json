And Raspberry Pi 5s to install your self-hosted smart home for top-3 winners.\n\nJoin us for a unique and exciting track focused on using Robonomics for smart home and robotics use cases. We offer remote access to two cutting-edge labs:\n\n- **Boston Dynamics Spot Lab:** Work with the renowned Boston Dynamics Spot, a quadrupedal robot known for its agility and maneuverability. Explore how to control Spot using web3 tools, create decentralized applications (dApps) for Spot, or use Spot's data to develop innovative services.\n- **Smart Home Lab:** At present, Polkadot is one of the largest DAOs in the world! There are many interesting events taking place in the ecosystem as part of the on-chain governance experiment. Robonomics developers suggest that hackathon participants increase Polkadot community immersion by integrating events related to voting, new treasury requests, epoch changes, and much more, into a typical smart home system.\n\nWith our track, you'll have the opportunity to:\n\n- Explore the potential of blockchain technology in the smart home and robotics industries\n- Gain hands-on experience working with cutting-edge robotics and smart home equipment\n- Collaborate with a global community of developers, engineers, and enthusiasts\n- Win exciting prizes and recognition for your innovative projects: A top-of-the-line Razer laptop, smart home equipment, and 500 DOT cash prize!\n\n**Boston Dynamic Spot Lab Description**\n\nHere are the instructions to work with Spot: <https://merklebot.notion.site/Docs-for-RoboHackathon-b057d24828194c78bac53a3885305382?pvs=4>\n\nThe SDK is relatively straightforward and we offer an easy-to-use platform to deploy your code to the robots directly.\n\nThe robot has a microphone, speaker, and camera so you can build use cases utilizing that equipment. For example, issuing an NFT certificate based on the sound or video data captured by the robot; or exploring ideas of how you can pay the robot to perform certain tasks, like going somewhere and inspecting a part of our lab.\n\n**Smart Home Lab Description**\n\nIn the Robonomics wiki, we have prepared a guide with an example of launching an autonomous agent. This agent allows you to link on-chain gov events with smart devices, such as a light bulb. The instruction is available at the link: <https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/on-chain-gov-experiment/>\n\nAt the initial stage of the hackathon, a mentor from Robonomics will provide anyone interested with access to the demo stand of a standard smart apartment. This stand will be available online 24/7. On this stand, developers can test their solutions and record real demonstrations of their code for the final presentation.\n\n[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/k9G2WQWcmj) to start looking for teammates and discuss your ideas with the team. We are excited to see what you’ll build at Consensus this year and our team will be there to support

bit of a hitch caused by the chaos in the early days of OpenGov, we're ready to restart the Robonomics crowdloan campaign. In this article, we'll take a look at the series of events that led to the restart of the campaign and present its new parameters.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Kusama OpenGov Causes cₕₐₒₛ\n\nThe long awaited arrival of the new governance system, OpenGov (Gov2), has finally arrived on Kusama, but it brought along a lot of chaos with it. The instatement of the new OpenGov system resulted in the previously scheduled auctions not being successfully enacted. The Kusama community had started [Gov1 referendum #252](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/252) for fixing the auctions schedule, but it did not enact successfully because of restrictions of AuctionAdmin privilege. This error was caused by the fact that in the new gov system it is mandatory to push the OpenGov proposal on the Auction track in order to launch auctions. It was decided to adjust OpenGov params with [a runtime upgrade](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/254), but this referendum was also not successful either due to a conflict between the Gov1 and Gov2 logic.\n\nAll in all, it took the Kusama community and developers a couple of weeks to figure out the intricacies of the new governance system. This was unforeseen, and had impacted the Robonomics project’s plans to bid in an parachain slot auction in our November 2022 crowdloan campaign. We have already dissolved [the November 2022 crowdloan](/blog/robonomics-crowdloan-campaigns-november-2022/) which was initiated on paraID 2237, and all KSM has been returned to the crowdloan contributors.\n\n## New Challenges for Extending the Lease of the Slot\n\n**The standard method** for swapping parachain leases prior to the release of OpenGov was the following:\n\n1. Generate new paraID using registrar(Reserve) extrinsic.\n2. Set on-chain ID for new paraID.\n3. Open crowdloan using crowdloan(Create) extrinsic.\n4. Bid in a parachain slot auction.\n5. If successful in the auction, then the developers would initiate governance action to swap over the lease from this donor paraID to the working parachain paraID using the forceLease and registrar:swap functions, similar to these previous referendums: [Karura lease swap](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/192), [Moonriver and Khala lease swap](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/468), [Shiden lease swap](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/199), [Parallel-Heiko lease swap](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/219), [Genshiro lease swap](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/246).\n6. The end result would be that the working parachain would have its lease extended, continue to produce blocks, and not suffer any downtime.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of OpenGov, thresholds for governance action on Kusama have become extraordinarily high. In basic terms, the new OpenGov system has multiple tracks. Each track can support a specific type of function (can call only particular extrinsics). Some tracks have limited power, such as tipping small amounts of KSM, but others have tremendous power, such as the Root track.\n\nThe thresholds for OpenGov tracks are extraordinarily high, and there are already actions within the Kusama community to lower them, as they are already causing issues for parachain projects such as [Kintsugi](https://twitter.com/kintsugi_btc/status/1599036329399943168). Simply put, a particular referendum must obtain enough support from the network's stakeholders (KSM holders) in order for the referendum to pass from the voting period to the confirmation period. \n\nIn order for the parachain to be able to carry out the aforementioned 6 step plan to swap the lease, it is needed to start the parachain auction schedule once again, this means that an OpenGov referendum should pass that restarts the auctions either via the Lease Admin track, or possibly as part of a runtime upgrade via the Root/Whitelisted Caller tracks. This is where the issue arises – in order for the referendum to be put into the confirmation period in a timely manner, it requires a significant percentage of all circulating supply of KSM tokens to vote in favour of the referendum. Typical voter turnout on Kusama is relatively low, meaning that it could potentially take multiple weeks for a Lease Admin track referendum to reach a threshold where it is realistically possible for the referendum to be pushed through to the confirmation period.\n\nWhile we still hope that the community will adjust OpenGov params, fortunately, there is a way that the parachain can use XCM in order to execute the 6 step plan without needing to utilise the relay chain’s new OpenGov system.\n\nWe can register a new paraID using the registrar(Reserve) extrinsic, and load a shell runtime to that paraID using the registrar(Register) extrinsic. This parachain should only initiate XCM messages for lease swaps. We then send an XCM message containing a lease swap request from the main parachain to the shell parachain. When the shell parachain wins an auction, and the lease becomes active, a minimal environment is launched which is able to send an XCM message to swap the lease slot with the main parachain.\n\n## New Parameters for Crowdloan Campaign\n\nAs [mentioned previously](https://robonomics.network/blog/robonomics-crowdloan-campaigns-november-2022/), we want to automate our crowdloan campaigns based on the statistics on the cost of slot leasing and ideal staking rate. Let’s take a look at current parameters for the renewal algorithm.\n\n<Card alignContent=\"center\">\n\n**1.

The XRT token can now be used as [xcXRT](https://moonbeam.network/announcements/moonriver-adds-cross-chain-capabilities-and-xcksm/) across the Moonriver ecosystem.\n\nWith this integration, Robonomics can leverage Moonriver smart contracts into our parachain on Kusama. In particular, we are interested in a scenario where the launch and datalog functions are called from a smart contract. This feature allows us to take on-chain data and be able to translate that into real-world events, which is especially important for smart device applicability.\n\nIn August, Moonbeam announced a proof-of-concept of [XCM-to-EVM functionality](https://moonbeam.network/announcements/xcm-to-evm-functionality-moonbase-alpha/) on Moonbase Alpha TestNet. This allows developers on remote chains to trigger function calls on the Moonriver/Moonbeam platforms, allowing them to tap into the features of the developer-friendly EVM on their home chains. If remote EVM calls through XCM are enabled on Moonbeam ecosystem, then IoT devices and applications of Robonomics will be able to remotely call smart contracts on Moonriver with the native security of the Kusama chain, through XCM. This opens up an entirely new realm of possibilities for IoT devices that work on Robonomics parachain, as they’ll be able to access the immutability and security of smart contracts.\n\nWe are looking forward to new functional upgrades to build a truly decentralized world of robotics, IoT and smart devices!\n\n## About Moonbeam\n\nMoonbeam is a smart contract platform for building cross-chain connected applications that can access users, assets, and services on any chain. By uniting functionality from Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, and more into a single platform, Moonbeam solves today’s fragmented user experience — unlocking true interoperability and paving the way for the next generation of applications. The Moonbeam platform uses integrated cross-chain messaging to allow developers to create smart contracts that access services across many remote blockchains. This approach, plus Moonbeam’s developer-friendly EVM platform, vast tool support, and modern Substrate architecture, creates the ideal development environment for building connected applications.\n\n## About Robonomics\n\nRobonomics Network — a decentralized cloud for secure and reliable control of IoT applications. It incorporates decentralization, blockchain technologies and token-based economics for the protection of smart devices and their data. Robonomics is aimed at: 1) control of smart devices with security and global availability, 2) serverless IoT applications for users for their privacy, 3) performing technical & economic transactions between people to machines and machine to machine for service efficiency. Moreover, the Robonomics parachain has an IoT subscription function that allows users to send device transactions without fee, for a period of one month. This allows, in particular, to make the smart home completely sovereign of centralized service providers, while keeping the ability to securely and remotely access devices at home.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.58cc5225382b60764694061b7a08c001.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.58cc5225382b60764694061b7a08c001.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.58cc5225382b60764694061b7a08c001.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.58cc5225382b60764694061b7a08c001.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-6fd4413f39a7b7cf073908ee14592f58'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-6fd4413f39a7b7cf073908ee14592f58)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAQUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAABAwUGB//EAC0QAAIBAwEGBQQDAQAAAAAAAAECAwAEEQUGEiExQXETFCIyUQdhgZFSobHh/8QAGAEBAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQYAAgP/xAAmEQACAgEDAgYDAAAAAAAAAAABAgARAwQSIUFhBSIxUWKxcZHR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDgFOOJwBk01GaZb%2bPcxqZUh323RI5wE%2bW/A/vFVYFmhB3CKWMGmjMUjIxBI6qcg9jUbe09q0e1%2bnadaXcZ0W7S5spIhJHhsvGQMPGw55B4j5B%2b1QbHaRba3tBZWV5d29tBLPHGwldlaQMwBVCqn1d8UZPLdznG%2b9QZkq2WyP0517ajTzfWS29vZklY5LlyviEc90AE4zwzyrLajapZ3bQxXdtdqAD4tuWKdvUoOR2rquy22d9pOz2lmO%2bt/K28SQ%2bWOOZzwOBneJyfn71J%2bIDWHFWi27vl7du/54jjyYcbA57rtOZa/o19oGqzadqsBhuY8EjOQwPJlPUH5qurb/VvXJNc1%2b2knhjhmgt/CZEOceokZ4njx/RFYivfStmbCp1Ap65A9Lg5QsTiNr0ltEiuTvSLHj%2bQPH9UTw3FXzcG6owAUz17UFSqmBqLJu6/UMRtxgy3MIYHhiP/AJURzbFZra6AlQ5VoyyspHIg9Kgpm9p7VmNiASjYP1AIlDyorMFDMAWbkBnnV29haKskVlr1ibZ5FkBmV43JUEAn0nHuPWqKlU66MxsNX6/kARXIuWl9YxiKW5bWbK6k57qtIZHP5X/T0qrpUqUUqOTcxI6Cp//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Crowdloan Campaigns, November 2022","path":"/blog/robonomics-crowdloan-campaigns-november-2022/","date":"November 18, 2022","description":"The first leasing period for the Robonomics parachain slot on the Kusama network is coming to an end. By winning auction #20, we got the opportunity to launch, set up and test the first projects based on Robonomics within the Polkadot ecosystem.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\nDuring 2022, the Robonomics parachain in Kusama was used in a dozen R&D projects and processed more than [4 million transactions](https://robonomics.subscan.io/) for IoT devices in total.\n\nThe Robonomics developers want to continue the implementation of parachain on the Kusama network. Now the entire Polkadot ecosystem is in a phase of dynamic development, and we want to be at the forefront of this process. In other words, we want to stay in the Kusama network.\n\nOur plans for 2023 include the active development around the idea of a decentralized cloud for the control of home IoT infrastructure. Now we are working to ensure that our [decentralized application](https://robonomics.app/) , [wiki project](https://wiki.robonomics.network/) and our educational resource, the [Robonomics Academy](http://robonomics.academy/), have all the necessary functions and information for IoT infrastructure owners.\n\nWe will also continue to experiment with opening new XCM channels inside the Polkadot ecosystem in order to find the most optimal “build” of the decentralized cloud for IoT, where not only our parachain, but the parachain ecosystem in its entirety is used to solve the problems arising from the world of the Internet of Things. For example, one of the most obvious scenarios in this direction is a project of decentralized data storage called Crust Network, with which we have already opened a set of HRMP channels. In 2023, all users of Robonomics IoT subscriptions will have their storage usage on Crust network paid for automatically. In 2023, we will try to apply a similar approach in regards to paying for the services of other parachains using funds stored on the Robonomics parachain.\n\nAs a result, today we have a working parachain for launching and sending the telemetry of IoT devices on the Kusama network. We are ready to continue our R&D work on the path to becoming a fully-fledged competitor to AWS for IoT, and next year we will place the maximum emphasis on supporting those who have made the important step of deciding to abandon the usual centralized clouds.\n\n\n## Automating Crowdloan Campaigns, part 2\n\nLast year, the concept of an autonomous oracle for crowdloan campaigns was first introduced in the article [Automating Crowdloan Campaigns](https://robonomics.network/blog/automating-kusama-crowdloan-campaigns/). For developers of the Robonomics parachain, finding an option to autonomize the life of the parachain is an important part of building a decentralized cloud for IoT. This year, for the first time, we will try to launch a crowdloan campaign on behalf of the parachain itself. Below you can find the calculations of the parameters of the new crowdloan campaign, which we plan to eventually turn into a completely autonomous process that will be able to independently launch new campaigns and successfully renew the slot lease.\n\nAs we expected, after the first batch of crazy auctions bids, the situation has become a lot more stable / normal, and now we can finally turn to some statistics on the cost of slot leasing. The renewal algorithm will collect statistics from the last dozen auctions to calculate the median leasing price. For example, the table below shows summarized statistics from July to November 2022 (information taken from [parachains.info](https://parachains.info/auctions/)).\n\n<div class=\"big-table\">\n\n  |                              | Auction 60   | Auction 59     | Auction 58 | Auction 57   | Auction 56 | Auction 55   | Auction 54      | Auction 53   | Auction 52   | Auction 51 | Auction 50  | Auction 49      | Auction 48    | \n  |------------------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|--------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|                                            \n  | **Winner**                   | Zeitgeist    | Crab Network   | -          | Crust Shadow | Genshiro   | DAO IPCI     | Parathread 2223 | Quartz       | Bit.Country  | Snow       | Subsocial   | Parathread 2130 | GM Parachain  |\n  | **Last Bid (KSM)**           | 500          | 11             | 0          | 1 807        | 2 000      | 111          | 1 001           | 1 005        | 3 500        | 13 926     | 1 001       | 1 131           | 5 014         |\n  | **Contributions**            | self-funded  | self-funded    | -          | 209          | 160        | self-funded  | self-funded     | self-funded  | self-funded  | 782        | self-funded | self-funded     | 738           |\n  | **Number of participants**   | 2            | 1              | 0          | 1            | 2          | 2            | 2               | 2            | 2            | 1          | 1           | 1               | 1             |\n\n</div>\n\n<Card alignContent=\"center\" back=\"transparent\">\n\n**In this case, the median bid is:**\n\n![beta subscript med equals 1001KSM](./images/robonomics-crowdloan-campaigns-november-2022/formula-1.svg)\n\n</Card>\n\n> Update December 5: Due to updates to the Kusama network ([Gov2 upgrade](https://twitter.com/nachortti/status/1588203599129190403)) the Robonomics crowdloan campaign will be restarted in the coming days. The collection limit will be increased to 10,050 KSM.\n\nThus, the algorithm will use this bid to estimate the cap of the crowdloan campaign.\n\nFurther, as mentioned in the [previous publication](https://robonomics.network/blog/automating-kusama-crowdloan-campaigns/), as the main criterion for calculating the reward for participation in the crowdloan, we use the estimation of the KSM stakers opportunity cost versus staking on the Relay Chain. The staking mechanism of the Polkadot ecosystem is designed in such a way that the system provides a return to those who assist in maintining the network’s security, whilst trying to ensure liquidity of the native token. To do this, the “*ideal staking rate*” parameter (to which the network should attain) was introduced. If the number of staked tokens falls below the ideal value, staking rewards increase (thereby prompting users to stake more, to enhance network security). And vice versa, if the staking rate exceeds the ideal, then the rewards drop exponentially.\n\nOur algorithm assumes that the system is in a state above ideal staking (because network security is important to us), so **the maximum annual interest rate for staking** that is possible under these conditions is determined by the ideal staking rate parameter and the maximum inflation rate for stakers (i.e. the total number of minted tokens to pay to validators and nominators):\n\n<Card alignContent=\"center\" back=\"transparent\">\n\n![i subscript 'ideal' ​equals I subscript NPoS divided by ​ x  subscript 'ideal'](./images/robonomics-crowdloan-campaigns-november-2022/formula-2.svg)\n\n</Card>\n\nYou can read more about these calculations in the [Token Economics](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/overview/2-token-economics.html) article from W3F Research.\n\nIn the Kusama network, the inflation rate is set at 10%, i.e. this is the maximum that will be minted to stakers in an ideal scenario. The ideal staking rate varies depending on the number of parachains and is currently 45% (as indicated on the Polkadot.js portal of the Kusama network). Thus, we get:\n\n<Card alignContent=\"center\" back=\"transparent\">\n\n![i subscript 'ideal' equals 0.1 divided by 0.45 multiply by 100 percent  equals 22.22 percent](./images/robonomics-crowdloan-campaigns-november-2022/formula-3.svg)\n\n</Card>\n\nAt the moment, the *real staking rate* is 52.6%, and the profit of staking participants is less than the ideal level (about 15%). Therefore, the algorithm can take the *ideal interest rate* parameter for the crowdloan campaign, thereby finding a level of reward for participation in the crowdloan that is fair for the network and attractive for stakers.\n\nNow we can calculate the reward for participation in the crowdloan campaign (XRT per 1 KSM), knowing the cost of tokens on the market:\n\n<Card alignContent=\"center\" back=\"transparent\">\n\n![R subscript 'perKSM' ​equals (1 multiply by $KSM ​multiply by i subscript 'ideal' ) divided by $XRT ](./images/robonomics-crowdloan-campaigns-november-2022/formula-4.svg)\n\n</Card>\n\nAt the current exchange rate of KSM and XRT, the crowdloan reward will be about **2.06 XRT per 1 KSM**. Knowing this value and the median cost of leasing a slot, it is easy to calculate the total payouts to crowdloan participants:\n\n<Card alignContent=\"center\" back=\"transparent\">\n\n![R subscript 'total' equals beta subscript 'med' ​multiply by R subscript 'perKSM' equals 2075.03XRT](./images/robonomics-crowdloan-campaigns-november-2022/formula-5.svg)\n\n</Card>\n\n> Update December 5: Due to Kusama network updates ([Gov2 upgrade](https://twitter.com/nachortti/status/1588203599129190403)) the Robonomics crowdloan campaign will be restarted in the coming days. The total reward pool has been increased to 20,750 XRT.\n\n## Movement from inflationary to deflationary parachain tokenomics\n\nThe cost of shared security on the Kusama network has stabilized. This can be seen from the recent slot auction statistics, projects do not need to allocate a substantial number of their parachain’s native token supply to reward crowdloan campaign participants. In addition to this fact, we should consider that a Robonomics-specific mechanism for burning native tokens is at the moment that a user activates an IoT subscription - meaning that the Robonomics architecture within the Polkadot ecosystem can actually be a parachain with deflationary tokenomics.\n\nIt is estimated that the total generation of new Robonomics parachain tokens in 2023 will be less than 0.38% of the total number of parachain token issuance. There is also ~370k XRT stored within the treasury of the Robonomics parachain, of which 3.5k XRT is automatically burned each month. This means that the Robonomics parachain in 2023 will show definite deflationary dynamics, with a high probability of the deflation of parachain token being greater than 3%. The actual amount of deflation will depend on the amount of XRT burned during IoT user subscriptions activation.\n\nDue to this, the Robonomics developers plan to cancel token staking during the next parachain slot leasing period, and focus heavily on further development of the parachain’s architecture. Additionally, there will be heavy focus on reducing the generation of new XRT tokens (to an extent that is practicable), and to actively develop more parachain services which utilize the expenditure (burning) of XRT tokens.\n\nKeep walking…\n\n![](./images/robonomics-crowdloan-campaigns-november-2022/keep-walking.jpg)\n\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.f1b14fbfc1466d6c1d0cf33d432c7b4e.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.f1b14fbfc1466d6c1d0cf33d432c7b4e.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.f1b14fbfc1466d6c1d0cf33d432c7b4e.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.f1b14fbfc1466d6c1d0cf33d432c7b4e.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-f523af10c436b761dfa81a05489f767a'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-f523af10c436b761dfa81a05489f767a)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUCAwYBBwj/xAApEAACAQMDBAICAgMAAAAAAAABAgMEBREAEiEGEzFBIlEyYXGRI0KB/8QAGAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMEAAH/xAAnEQABAwIEBgMBAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDBBESMVFxIUFhkaHRFCKB8P/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A876vo6WetnENLE0kh9D1%2byfWqU2h13glc8gHBI05ouoJaJe1SQRQU5zkKNz5%2b9x8kf1omgc1XSR073j5Ly1vQXPr98FC3e2m2SRRSzJJMybnRQfh9c%2b9BRRvK%2b2MZOMn9D2f41zNJLUSvLKzyux%2bTnknT/pq2x1STx1MZO50GC2B796opqZ1XMIo%2bF9eiTVywtc6VrSI9Mz3OvPxos/NE8L7ZBg4yOcgj7H61EAYLMdqjydaPqm1CgMVPDEysjuGUHd9e9JrZO1NVpIJhT8NiVou5tODggfeeM%2bs50NXTPpZDE6xI7cRdKa9sgD2g2OqJvtmqbI8UFxhngrJFEojdRtMbAFWDA8nOQRjjHnSvTO53CKsp6YGOY1UUfbeaSpaXeMegw%2bPvgfelmpIy7CMef8Abo3hod9clOONpGwgJ55OPGmFBbXqROYRG7QwtUt3JBGCi4/Hd%2bRz6HJ1KjempJ45aqkFVSrIytB3GTf8Tg7hyNbfoawv1TeKe2VtfOq2%2bDEUu0Myx%2bQig8KMsTnnTQFQyEBpeTYA2Jz7D34WXWko1DgS1FQZqMPTyqBThKg43BgeXUDjjz5GmMVJcy0TWizzRUrwoJykMkqhlX5OSRxnyQOBoy%2b9UrYLlW2mwWukpexinkqZR3pZSCSXBI%2bJJ%2buNIqnrPqSqlLy3qtzM/wDkCPsD%2bByFwDxx/GmRzOhdjjNigldFILYL7k9EdUU1xUVJvNomaBIXWnZ4pIRvI%2bMgIHOMeDwc6Amo6RlJWeaAQUfcleZRMslQP9U2/iGHgt49%2btWQdbdS0kwMd6rH7MmYxKwkCnkcBgfWR/3T3p3qCHqevW13m1UjVDRBYqynzC6FTkMwH5nx5Poa0kzpnY5DcrROijGHDbY78j7WNuNslopIkqUWCSWJJ0HcDgo4yp%2bOcfwedLmUoxDAgjXYHWVqbpi83Wz01U0kVQq99xGqmSMfMKRzggr5GPPjWUvIpjdqqGlhkipllYRJJL3GQY8FsDP9DSyF2SICxvwOR13HJf/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"In the footsteps of Robonomics Town Hall 2022","path":"/blog/robonomics-town-hall-2022-result/","date":"October 15, 2022","description":"Robonomics Town Hall 2022 was an event in which the Robonomics project developers tried to test the currently available governance tools for the XRT token holder DAO. Now the project has the ability to poll token holders of XRT on Ethereum, and critically we have a governance management tool in the Polkadot ecosystem.","content":"\n## Moving from Town Hall to the Forum\n\nIn the near future, something similar to the ancient forum awaits us, where everyone has the opportunity to share their ideas about improving Robonomics. If your proposal gains support from the XRT token holders, then the execution of your proposal is carried out automatically.\n\nHowever, it is important not to settle on using the Town Hall as our main form of Governance. Having questions that are prepared by the Robonomics developers to a vote, holding a meeting of XRT holders every 3/6/12 months is not the best option for the development of a Web3 project. As it currently stands, the Robonomics parachain has on-chain governance functionality, and there are no actual barriers stopping anyone in the community from starting governance proceedings (discussion / proposal / referendum). Therefore, by the end of October, instructions for creating proposals and on how to vote will become available, the result of which will directly affect the operation of, at least, the Robonomics parachain.\n\n## Snapshot & Polkassembly\n\nIt is impossible to influence the already existing Robonomics smart contracts in Ethereum. In the case of the parachain though, it is possible to change the Robonomics program code by voting. This is the main difference between [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/developers.robonomics.eth) and [Polkassembly](https://robonomics.polkassembly.io/) governance platforms.\n\nIn addition to requesting changes to how Robonomics works on the Ethereum and Kusama networks, the community can now use Snapshot and Polkassembly to create simple polls that can help draw attention to a particular topic or issue.\n\nAny XRT holder can submit a request to allocate XRT from the Treasury for any activity. There are currently over 370,000 XRT tokens in the Robonomics parachain treasury, of which the community can apply for grants using Polkassembly. Snapshot also has a Treasury mechanism. By the end of October, the developers of the project will agree on the amount of XRT that we will move from the DAO of the core team to the Snapshot treasury.\n\nTherefore, from the beginning of November, similar requests for grants will be available within Ethereum.\n\nAs always, any opportunity can turn into a double-edged sword, so we are ready for a little chaos and expect an influx of strange requests for funding (for example, meetups somewhere in Atlantis, at the bottom of the sea).\n\n## Why was there no actual vote on the fifth question?\n\nInitially, 5 questions were announced for Town Hall 2022 for discussion, but in fact, only the first four were voted on. In the fifth question, the project developers wanted to draw attention to the presentation of the Smart Home concept based on the Web3 ecosystem of IoT devices. For the Robonomics developers, the issue of producing the Smart Home ecosystem is a special point of discussion this year: we spend a lot of effort on presenting the concept of a Smart Home managed by a decentralized cloud to the community. We will need a little more time to complete the work, so we plan to present what we have planned in November.\n\n## And now to the voting results of Robonomics Town Hall 2022\n\nSince the voting went in parallel for the Ethereum and Kusama networks, each of them had its own nuances. On Snapshot, voting on 4 questions was available immediately, from August 28 to October 2, and we provided voting not only for XRT holders, but also for AIR and AIRA ID legacy token holders. On the parachain, voting took place sequentially, in an order, determined by the amount of endorsements received, the highest endorsed vote was pushed to a proposal each period. Voting lasted with a launch period of 7 days. Thus, the community has chosen the following order:\n\n1. Vote to Burn 7 Million XRT: from 30.08 to 07.09\n2. ROS2 Support Grants: from 07.09 to 15.09\n3. Parachain Gov2 Interest: from 15.09 to 22.09\n4. Home Assistant Support Grants: from 22.09 to 29.09\n\nPolkadot votes additionally have an execution period of 3 days on our parachain. Thus, the last vote was sent for execution on October 2, coinciding with the end of voting on Snapshot.\n\nTo vote on the parachain, holders must place their tokens, which are locked for the voting period. However, it is possible to strengthen your vote by locking tokens for a longer period (i.e. 10 XRT locked for a two-time period will be counted as 20 XRT). For consistency with voting on Snapshot, we decided not to take into account this modifier and count the number of tokens in a “pure” form.\n\nBelow are the statistics for all votes.\n\n## Vote to

The seven million XRT that have been hanging by the sword of Damocles since 2018 will be burned in 2023. In the coming weeks, the budget for the ROS2 and Home Assistant grants will be allocated and managed by the grant program.

Ora il progetto può creare sondaggi per i possessori del token XRT su Ethereum e, soprattutto, dispone di uno strumento per la gestione della governance nell’ecosistema Polkadot.","content":"\n## SPOSTANDOSI DAL TOWN HALL AL FORUM\n\nNel futuro prossimo ci aspetta qualcosa di simile all’antico forum, dove tutti hanno l’opportunità di condividere le proprie idee sul miglioramento dei Robonomics. Se la vostra proposta ottiene il supporto dei token holder, questa viene eseguita automaticamente.\n\nTuttavia, è importante non accontentarsi di utilizzare il Town Hall come nostra principale forma di governance. Votare le domande che vengono preparate dagli sviluppatori di Robonomics e avere un meeting degli holder di XRT ogni 3/6/12 mesi non è l’opzione migliore per lo sviluppo di un progetto Web3. Allo stato attuale, la parachain Robonomics ha delle funzionalità di governance on-chain e non ci sono barriere effettive che impediscano a chiunque nella community di avviare un processo di governance (discussione / proposta / referendum). Pertanto, entro la fine di ottobre saranno disponibili le istruzioni per la creazione di proposte e le modalità di voto, il cui risultato influenzerà direttamente il funzionamento della parachain.\n\n## SNAPSHOT E POLKASSEMBLY\n\nÈ impossibile influenzare gli smart contract Robonomics già esistenti su Ethereum. Nel caso della parachain invece, è possibile modificare il codice del programma Robonomics attraverso il voto. Questa è la principale differenza fra le piattaforme di governance [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/developers.robonomics.eth) e [Polkassembly](https://robonomics.polkassembly.io/).\n\nOltre a richiedere delle modifiche alle funzionalità di Robonomics sulle reti di Ethereum e Kusama, la community ora può utilizzare Snapshot e Polkassembly per creare dei semplici sondaggi che possono aiutare ad attirare l’attenzione su un particolare argomento o problema.\n\nOgni token holder può presentare una richiesta per allocare degli XRT dalla tesoriera per qualsiasi attività. Attualmente ci sono oltre 370.000 token XRT nella tesoreria della parachain, dei quali la community può richiedere sovvenzioni attraverso Polkassembly. Anche Snapshot ha un meccanismo per la tesoriera. Entro la fine di ottobre, gli sviluppatori del progetto si metteranno d’accordo sulla quantità di XRT che verranno trasferiti dalla DAO del core team alla tesoreria di Snapshot. Dall’inizio di novembre, queste richieste di sovvenzione saranno disponibili anche su Ethereum.   \n\nCome sempre, ogni opportunità può trasformarsi in un’arma a doppio taglio, quindi siamo pronti per un po’ di caos e ci aspettiamo un afflusso di strane richieste di finanziamento (come degli incontri da qualche parte ad Atlantide, in fondo al mare).\n\n## PERCHÈ NON C’È STATA UNA VOTAZIONE SUL QUINTO QUESITO?\n\nInizialmente erano state annunciate 5 domande per la discussione del Town Hall 2022, ma in realtà solo le prime quattro sono state votate. Nella quinta domanda, gli sviluppatori del progetto hanno voluto attirare l’attenzione sulla presentazione del concetto di Smart Home basata su un ecosistema Web3 di dispositivi IoT. Per gli sviluppatori di Robonomics, la questione sulla produzione dell’ecosistema Smart Home è un punto di discussione speciale di quest’anno: ci impegniamo molto per presentare alla community il concetto di Smart Home gestita da un cloud decentralizzato. Avremo bisogno di un po’ più di tempo per completare il lavoro e abbiamo in programma di presentare a novembre quello che abbiamo pianificato.\n\n## RISULTATI DELLE VOTAZIONI DEL ROBONOMICS TOWN HALL 2022\n\nPoiché le votazioni sono state eseguite in parallelo sulle reti Ethereum e Kusama, ognuna di esse aveva le sue sfumature. Su Snapshot, la votazione per le 4 domande è stata subito disponibile, dal 28 agosto al 2 ottobre, e abbiamo fornito le votazioni non solo per i possessori di XRT, ma anche per gli holder dei token legacy AIR e AIRA ID. Mentre sulla parachain, la votazione si è svolta in sequenza, in un ordine determinato dalla quantità di approvazioni ricevute, il voto approvato col più alto endosement è stato spinto come proposta in ogni periodo. Le votazioni sono durate 7 giorni e la community ha scelto il seguente ordine:\n\n1. Vote to Burn 7 Million XRT: dal 30.08 al 07.09\n2. ROS2 Support Grants: dal 07.09 al 15.09\n3. Parachain Gov2 Interest: dal 15.09 al 22.09\n4. Home Assistant Support Grants: dal 22.09 al 29.09\n\nI voti su Polkadot hanno inoltre un periodo di esecuzione di 3 giorni sulla nostra parachain. Quindi l’ultimo voto è stato inviato per l’esecuzione il 2 ottobre, in coincidenza con la fine delle votazioni su Snapshot.\n\nPer votare sulla parachain, gli holder devono posizionare i propri token, che sono bloccati per il periodo della votazione. È tuttavia possibile rafforzare il voto bloccando i token per un periodo più lungo (ad es. 10 XRT bloccati per un periodo di due volte superiore verranno conteggiati come 20 XRT). Per coerenza con la votazione su Snapshot, abbiamo deciso di non tener conto di questo modificatore e di contare il numero di token così per come sono.\n\n\n## VOTO PER BRUCIARE 7 MILIONI DI

Vote to burn 7 million XRT\n2. Parachain Governance version 2 R&D interest\n3. Home Assistant support grants\n4. ROS2 support grants\n5. Web3 smart home ecosystem funding forecast\n\n## General information about Town Hall 2022\n\nThe Town Hall will be the first meeting of XRT token holders, and we will discuss the tokenomics of the project.\n\n**Ways which you can participate:** \n\n- On the Ethereum network using [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org/). Direct Link: [https://snapshot.org/#/developers.robonomics.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/developers.robonomics.eth)\n- On the Kusama network using [polkassembly.io](http://polkassembly.io/). Direct link: [https://robonomics.polkassembly.io/](https://robonomics.polkassembly.io/)\n\n**Timeline:** \n\n- **Voting launch**: from August 28 to September 3;\n- **Duration of the voting period**: from August 28 to October 2;\n- Finalization and publication of vote results in our blog: mid-October.\n\n### Snapshot Voting Mechanics\n\nSnapshot allows token holders to vote on community proposals without spending ETH on gas fees. This is because you do not need to send a transaction to the Ethereum network, instead you simply sign a message with your accounts private key. You should vote with the address in which you hold ERC-20 XRT tokens.\n\n**The most important thing to remember about Snapshot voting:**\n\nIn order to vote on each proposal, you must have been holding ERC-20 XRT tokens at the time (block) that the vote was created. This means that if you try to vote on a proposal with ERC-20 XRT tokens which were acquired after the creation of the vote, your vote will not be counted.\n\nVoting type: [Single choice voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types#single-choice-voting). A simple vote, choose your response to the question. Your voting weight is equal to the amount of XRT in your account’s balance.\n\nWe recommend clicking the “Join” button on the main Robonomics page in Snapshot: [https://snapshot.org/#/developers.robonomics.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/developers.robonomics.eth)\n\n### Polkassembly Voting Mechanics\n\nThe Robonomics parachain on Kusama has recently added a user-friendly interface (thanks to our friends at Polkassembly!) which makes it easier for accessing the parachain’s referendum module.\n\nThe functionality of voting on the parachain is practically identical to voting on the Kusama Relay Chain. Therefore, if you have ever participated in governance voting within the Dotsama ecosystem, then you should already be familiar with this process.\n\nThe vote which is initiated on the Robonomics parachain will have the same vote options as the Snapshot vote on Ethereum.\n\nAn important feature of the vote on the parachain is the conviction mechanism, that could also be referred to as “**Voluntary Locking”.** With this mechanism you can increase the weight of your vote (voting power) by increasing the lock up period for your tokens (note: during the lockup period, your tokens cannot be transferred). For example, if you select a voting power of 0.1x, then the XRT tokens that you chose to vote with will not be locked at all. However, if you choose to vote with 1x conviction (voting power), then your XRT tokens will be locked for a period of 8 days. Read more about this mechanism on the Polkadot wiki: [https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#voluntary-locking](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#voluntary-locking)\n\nBookmark the voting page: [https://robonomics.polkassembly.io/](https://robonomics.polkassembly.io/)\n\n## Vote to burn 7 million XRT\n\nThis is the story of the sword of Damocles: 7 million XRT, which are currently locked in a Dutch auction smart contract on Ethereum. Is this a vestige of our project’s evolution? Or should it instead be kept as an untouchable reserve in order to one day be injected into the ecosystem to boost the development of the project? Read a detailed blog post about the history of the project’s tokenomics development in this article: [https://robonomics.network/blog/7-years-of-robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-xrt/](https://robonomics.network/blog/7-years-of-robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-xrt/)\n\n## Parachain Governance version 2 R&D interest\n\nGavin Wood help a presentation based around upcoming updates to the on-chain protocol governance mechanism during the Polkadot Decoded 202 conference. You can read more about this here: [Gov2: Polkadot’s Next Generation of Decentralized Governance](https://polkadot.network/blog/gov2-polkadots-next-generation-of-decentralised-governance/). Robonomics plans to migrate to this new version of on-chain governance after the firsts tests have been completed on Kusama. During the Town Hall, our parachain’s developers would like to know how many community members would like to participate in the parachains governance systems with the introduction of Governance 2.0. If you are interested, then vote “for”, if you do not want to participate in the development of onchain protocol management, then you can simply skip this vote.\n\n## Home Assistant support grants\n\nOne of the first, and the main use case we would like to advance for Robonomics in 2022-2023 is our integration with Home Assistant. Home Assistant has over half a million users, and is one of the best open source home automation solutions available today.\n\nYou can already purchase a Robonomics IoT subscription and [connect your home assistant to the Robonomics parachain](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/home-assistant-begin/). This will allow you to receive telemetry and control devices remotely, without the need to connect up to centralized cloud providers. These are only basic features, and there is demand for more useful services within smart homes. With this idea in mind, we propose to launch a mini-grants program (with grants <5,000 DAI) aimed at generating ideas and easily implementing them in the form of Home Assistant automation scripts (in conjunction with the Robonomics parachain). As part of this vote, let’s determine how much XRT will be allocated to the total budget which will support the grants programme for the development of Home Assistant use cases for the next 6 months.\n\nEvery 20 XRT which votes “aye” will add 1 XRT to the Home Assistant grant budget, every 20 XRT “nay” will reduce the budget by 1 XRT.\n\n## ROS2 support grants\n\nOur origins are in robotics, and ROS (Robot Operating System) was the first area of experimentation for us. ROS, similar to Home Assistant, is the most popular open source framework, but not for home automation, instead it is for complex robotics. The first version of ROS had many problems that prevented it from taking it’s rightful place within real projects outside of laboratories and prototypes of start-up projects. The ROS community has been developing the ROS2 implementation for some time now, and it is already a more mature solution. The Robonomics team wants to continue the development & integration of ROS2 in 2022-2023. As part of this vote, let’s determine how much XRT will be allocated to the total budget which will support the grants programme for the development of ROS2-direction for the next 6 months.\n\nEvery 20 XRT which votes “aye” will add 1 XRT to the ROS2 grant budget, every 20 XRT “nay” will reduce the budget by 1 XRT.\n\n## Web3 smart home ecosystem funding forecast\n\nThis topic requires an entire publication dedicated to it, so for now let’s focus on the first 4 questions as described here.

For example, Boston Dynamics, a well-known robotics company, had more than 25 years of R&D under its belt when it launched its first fully-fledged commercial product. Another good example of simpler-looking IoT solutions: Zigbee, MQTT and LoRa protocols, but they were born back in the middle of the 2000s. Do not forget about this when looking at the history of the formation of the Robonomics project, which is at the intersection of robotics and new Internet technologies.\n\n*On our website you can see the project development trajectory starting from the first experiments in 2015: [https://robonomics.network/timeline/](https://robonomics.network/timeline/)*\n\nWe will soon have our first community vote, it will be in regards as to the fate of 7 million XRT that hangs over us like a sword of Damocles today.\n\n## XRT Initial Distribution History\n\nHaving started in 2015 with the first experiments and publications on the use of smart contracts to control robots, by 2017 we had our first plan for creating Robonomics to implement additional Ethereum features for [Robot-as-a-Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_as_a_service) tasks. We then carried out the initial distribution of XRT tokens, distributing 10% of the proposed initial emission amongst the community and to the first developers of the project.\n\n![ICO Stage](./images/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT/7-years-img-1.png)\n\nThe project developers proposed to divide the remaining 9 million XRT between the DAO of developers (20%) and the community (70%), but this was to be only after the full launch of Robonomics on Ethereum, which was planned in 2018-2019.\n\nAnd then the crypto winter came...\n\nWe launched the beta version of Robonomics in 2018, and in April 2019 we released version [1.0.0](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics_contracts/releases/tag/v1.0) of the Robonomics smart contracts.\n\nBy the end of 2018, the projects main goals were to keep the core team, and to continue working in anticipation of the launch of Ethereum 2.0, which at the time seemed realistically possible by 2020. \n\nWe decided to postpone the distribution of the community’s 70% of the XRT initial supply until the launch of Ethereum 2.0, with the belief that this event, regardless of the general market sentiment, will be more appopriate. The remaining 20% of XRT was agreed by the developer DAO to not be utilized until the community is activated, which was supposed to be around the same time as the Serenity release. In general, for us, the release of Ethereum 2.0 was the metaphorical lighthouse during the blizzard of the crypto winter.\n\n![Ethereum 1.0 Stage](./images/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT/7-years-img-2.png)\n\nIt was a difficult time for us, we lost some of our dear project participants, and every month the situation did not get easier. Fortunately, work on Robonomics continued to be maintained by a group of 5-6 developers. That year, we decided to try out a new blockchain, similar (but a little different) to Ethereum 2.0. This blockchain was proposed by the Parity team, who were already familiar faces for the entire Ethereum community, and it was also led by Gavin Wood. That is how we started working on the Robonomics implementation for Polkadot.\n\nBy mid-2019, the Robonomics development team was one of the first to launch their own network/blockchain on Substrate. And by the spring of 2020, the implementation of Robonomics for Polkadot already had almost all the basic functionality that we wanted to present to the crypto community before entering the IoT market. We worked without money for several years, eating Chinese noodles and drawing diagrams.\n\nThen a small miracle happened...\n\nThe emergence of a large-scale DeFi segment (in particular, Uniswap in 2020), the interest of the entire crypto community in Polkadot projects, and the presence of an existing Ethereum-based tokenomics have moved interest in XRT off the ground.\n\nThe community has grown substantially by 2021 - the number of holders of XRT tokens has multiplied compared to 2017, the token began to be traded on many exchanges. Around Robonomics, life began to boil, the project continued its development after the crypto winter. Today it is important to focus on the future for the entire community, and not on trying to implement the plans of 2017 after 5 years. Thus, the question arose: what to do with 70% of the initial emission, which has turned into a sword of Damocles for the entire community?\n\n![Token contract overview](./images/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT/7-years-img-3.png)\n\n## Robonomics Town Hall Summer 2022\n\nDuring the last week of August (August 28-September 3), be ready to participate in the discussion and voting with XRT tokens on the development of the project for the first time.\n\nThe article you just read refers to the accompanying information for voting on the issue of burning 7 million XRT tokens. Below are 4 more votes that the DAO of developers offers to the community and which I will talk about in the next post.\n\nQuestions for the community:\n\n1. Vote to burn 7 million XRT\n2. Parachain Governance version 2 R&D\n3. ROS2 support grants\n4. Home Assistant support grants\n5. Web3 smart home ecosystem funding request\n\n## XRT burn voting mechanism\n\nRobonomics already lives on top of two networks. We will vote in the most convenient ways for Ethereum and Kusama. In the case of Ethereum, we chose Snapshot, and in the case of Polkadot, the native Governance v1 referendum mechanism will be applied.\n\nAfter around a month, an XRT holder will be able to vote for or against. The weight of the vote will be proportional to the number of tokens on the account’s balance. At the end of the month, the values of the two votes will be summed up - if 51% of the total number of voted tokens is “for”, then the entire balance of the Dutch auction contract will be sent to the furnace (burnt). If 51% of the votes are “against”, then we will explore other options to determine the further distribution of the tokens from the auction balance. Or, perhaps we will hold an auction of 7 million tokens on the day of the launch of Ethereum 2.0, as we planned 5 years ago, but in all likelihood in 2032 😄","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT.62c183a.996bf22f5799c4278139f8006c6d21ec.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT.9ea8d39.996bf22f5799c4278139f8006c6d21ec.jpg 480w","/assets/static/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT.6b2ed88.996bf22f5799c4278139f8006c6d21ec.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT.62c183a.996bf22f5799c4278139f8006c6d21ec.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-b4284785caec4376ae5818d5304d1f97'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-b4284785caec4376ae5818d5304d1f97)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAQUBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEBQYHAwL/xAAtEAABBAECBAQFBQAAAAAAAAABAgMEEQAFEhMhMVEGQXGRBxQVImEyQlKhwf/EABkBAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEBv/EACERAAICAQQCAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECABEDBBIhQTHwIjJR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDAMMM0n4Y%2bHNA1fQtbXrcgIlOoLEZVG45A3cQfyJNCh%2b0HvnrQa5q4M20XM2z02nesJsJHmo9AO5xCKJFg0asdDklokiNBmx5MppuShCt5ZKwAog8kqvyvmR6Y9vIBk5GKqSBZkaoFKiDyI5YmPtWXFemPvQUcGOpw8NlTgUpCTzAsda6X2rOEWM5IXSdqUjqtZpKfU4viPtx76JrhRsxCoLJnDDJHUmIkRtLLS%2bNIu1rB5JFdBkdkKwddwE21WmbTZDicgkeaN0fy/Fjurhj2Dqc2BHmMw5DjLUtvhPpSa3pvp/noSPPGWGWK7nPHsHT1TeCEPsNqdfDFOHbtsfrJ6bRY98vVuwV6c18n4UkF4ojle7eBQH3OdgfM/nM4wodh7Zmybu4S96w0tUaNpxa8OhU1RQmSw5amqSlX3Krknt65VdY0z6Y4htUyNJKrJ4CioJ6edfn%2bjkdQ7D2wGNFAPJ4hFJJqz05YmGGVYqE//9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics & Crust Networks Strategic Partnership!","path":"/blog/robonomics-and-crust-networks-strategic-partnership/","date":"July 22, 2022","description":" This partnership means there will be much deeper integration between the Crust and Robonomics parachains on Kusama, as well as an interesting new approach for cross-chain collaboration to simplify the user experience.","content":"\nimport RoboList from '~/components/blocks/List.vue'\nimport RoboListItem from '~/components/blocks/ListItem.vue'\n\nWe are happy to announce that Crust and Robonomics have started collaborating to bring resilient data storage infrastructure to robotics and smart devices. This partnership means there will be much deeper integration between the Crust and Robonomics parachains on Kusama, as well as an interesting new approach for cross-chain collaboration to simplify the user experience.\n\nThere are two main objectives that we are looking to achieve together:\n\n<robo-list>\n    <robo-list-item>\n        The resilient storage of data that comes from Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics devices. Currently, the Robonomics parachain uses IPFS both on our robotics controllers and centralized pinning services to make it persistent. Having access to Crust’s decentralized pinning service will offer users cryptographic proofs of storage in many redundant storage locations.\n    </robo-list-item>\n    <robo-list-item>\n        Decentralized hosting of dApps. This is something that was not available before, and as a result, Robonomics dApps had to be hosted by traditional cloud providers or using owned hardware. With Crust, dApps can have decentralized hosting, which guarantees that services will remain available. The fact that developers can create services with no single point of failure, that will remain available for users globally, is extremely important for robotics and any physical world deployments in general.\n    </robo-list-item>\n</robo-list>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"500\" height=\"282\" src=\"./images/robonomics-and-crust-networks-strategic-partnership/spot.gif\">\n</p>\n\nRobonomics team has already started exploring Crust Network and has been impressed by the diligent approach to documentation. You can already launch a [Boston Dynamics robot in Bay Area lab](https://spot.merklebot.com) via a Robonomics parachain transaction, whilst the data will be recorded on Crust. Feel free to try it out for yourself on [spot.merklebot.com](https://spot.merklebot.com).\n\n![Demo web app](./images/robonomics-and-crust-networks-strategic-partnership/demo.png)\n\nNow, we will focus on XCM integration between the Crust Shadow and Robonomics parachains. This will allow us to send transactions for storage directly from smart devices in a fully decentralized way. It should be noted that there is an interesting set of questions related to transaction fees when services are delivered by one parachain to another, which needs to be answered.\n\nWe believe that the user should only pay for a transaction within the parachain they were using. In our case, when a Robonomics parachain user wants to save the data from robotics and smart devices to the Crust Network - they will only have to pay for services in XRT.\n\nThe Robonomics parachain is working on deploying a special pallet that would be able to send a transaction to Crust Shadow with the requirement to save the data and pay from the Robonomics parachain account directly in CSM tokens.  The user will be charged some XRT to compensate for the storage cost automatically.\n\nEventually, parachains will automatically sell native tokens on a DEX to replenish the balance of other parachain tokens that offer additional services. It is mindblowing to realize that this fully decentralized and autonomous scenario is already realistic!\n\nWe are looking forward to an exciting future collaborating on truly decentralized solutions in the field of robotics, IoT and smart devices.\n\n## About Crust\n\nCrust Network is a versatile, purpose-built storage blockchain that delivers truly decentralized file storage and hosting capabilities for the entire Web3 ecosystem, empowering privacy and data ownership.

In the coming months, the project R&D team will devote itself to integrations with the Statemine, Karura, Moonriver, Crust and KILT parachains.\n\nWe took the first steps towards parachain communication 1.5 years ago, [demonstrating the exchange of messages between two blockchains](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/cross-chain-messages/) during a master class in St. Petersburg. Last year, [Gav published a series of articles in which XCMP was modified](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format-3b77b1373392) - it was turned into cross-consensus messaging (XCM) and received it’s first version number above zero.\n\nTwo months after the refactoring of XCM, the Robonomics team have now completed our tests on Rococo and we are ready to integrate with other parachains in the Kusama ecosystem.\n\n## Basic support for XCM in Robonomics\n\nAdhering to the view that Kusama itself is a heterogeneous network, the Robonomics developers are trying to implement IoT/Robotics-specific functionality into the Robonomics parachain code.\n\nWe will maximize our usage of the features from other parachains which can help to implement smart home/city or industrial scenarios when possible. For example, this year we plan to use the existing solutions of other parachains (not create our own solutions for): (1) personal balances of user access tokens, (2) dapp and IoT device user identification system, (3) large file storage, (4) use of IoT devices in work smart contracts.\n\nAt the time of the release of version 2.0, Robonomics is ready for integration with any parachain running on the Kusama network. The software implementation of XCM support can be found in [the alpha runtime directory](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/tree/master/runtime/alpha) of the main Robonomics repository on Substrate.\n\nIn May and June 2022, compatibility tests with the Relay chain were already carried out on Rococo network using the example of teleporting the native Rococo Relay Chain token - ROC (analogous to KSM, but on the Rococo test network) - to the Robonomics parachain.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BJHSFDZt0y4\n\n[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1534081132765097984)\n\nIf you have any ideas based on integrating Robonomics with other Kusama parachains, email research@robonomics.network or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/atduhWZpVr) for discussion in our main community channels.\n\n## Integration with Statemine\n\nThe main goal of our integration with Statemine is the full launch of the liability() function of the Robonomics parachain. The liability() function is quite similar to the main Robonomics function in Ethereum, which allows you to organize a full cycle - using a robot as a service. From the moment of integration with Statemine, developers of IoT applications will be able to create their own token in Statemine (or use any existing Statemine token) to launch a smart device/robot to execute a given program. After the user program is executed, the tokens will be automatically transferred to the balance of the robot.\n\nBack in spring, we showed a simple example of using tokens in Statemine to launch a coffee machine and described one of the scenarios of the tokenization development of access to equipment in the article: [Coworking for crypto-anarchists, p1](https://blog.aira.life/coworking-for-crypto-anarchists-p1-5ebecb252f2d). Accounting for the use of equipment in the office and differential distribution of access to equipment fits very well with access tokens in conjunction with the liability () function.\n\nAnother example of the use of Statemine integration with Robonomics, based on our existing use cases is the ability to use a telescope to mint NFT postcards. Today, user balances are stored in Statemine, and then NFTs are issued using RMRKs. Starting with our integration with Statemine, the telescope will be able to receive a task to create an image through the liability () function, and access tokens sent to the telescope will go to the balance of the telescope only after adding a link to NFT in the results of the liability () execution.\n\nWork status: Q3 2022\n\n## Integration with Karura\n\nAs long term builders on both the Ethereum and Dotsama ecosystems, Robonomics believes in integrating decentralized means of exchange for Robonomics parachain native token (XRT). Listing XRT on Karura swap is the ideal way to allow our token community to swap parachain native tokens in a decentralized way, and opening these HRMP communication channels is the first step in achieving that goal.\n\nOne of the ideas of Robonomics developers for further integration with Karura is automated currency and value exchange points for Kusama network tokens. We will share more about this separately, and certainly after the first step with the addition of XRT to Karura Swap.\n\nWork status: Q3 2022\n\n## Integration with Moonriver\n\nThe Robonomics parachain can become a universal mechanism for launching smart devices from within Moonriver smart contracts. We are currently working on this architecture and discussing a separate carbon footprint offset scenario using [DAO IPCI smart contracts](https://github.com/DAO-IPCI/DAO-IPCI) on the Moonriver parachain. \n\nWork status: Q3 2022\n\n## Integration with KILT\n\nOver the years of studying the robotics market, Robonomics developers have agreed that device identification is one of the most important tasks when considering complex scenarios for automating city life, logistics and industrial supply chains. KILT is an excellent example of continuing work towards integrating the functionality of various parachains within a heterogeneous network and solving problems that are significant for the IoT market.\n\nWork status: Q4 2022\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.1ffc44b851d313c35c5fe267555bfa2d.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.1ffc44b851d313c35c5fe267555bfa2d.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.1ffc44b851d313c35c5fe267555bfa2d.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.1ffc44b851d313c35c5fe267555bfa2d.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-c1b0301ead9a4865cd579676e73b7863'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-c1b0301ead9a4865cd579676e73b7863)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQYBBAADAgcI/8QAKxAAAgECBQMDBAMBAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABRIhMRNBYQYUUSIycYEVFkPR/8QAFwEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwIAAf/EACIRAAICAgIABwAAAAAAAAAAAAECABEDMRIhIkFRkaGx4f/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A8%2bYnEYffQvoCn9U5R72TPqegPXaHpuitawBuSXB3v8dsNDVSxoRTyrJM0zaOrkyvL6mrjpIzLO0SahGoBNz%2bgTbmwPwcUoI%2bpIo%2brSedIubeB3OOxBNlnoOqzzJqyaszZaiCKSH2sqxRGQxuB1LMSrLrBDKb7FSLMcJeS15yqqpquERtPEQ69RdlYfabd7c/vxisYDMORoSMvJQeIswa6lWIPbvjkYJVV2aKQLGQHJU2UngH4OLmbVK11VPVLHFC8rl%2blEpCLq3Nr8C/bz4xvqqv%2bUvTxQzGZpdcYUje6gEMOO17/m%2bIfwnrUfDjV0YuaI0K3v8APqCcRglHkWaydHpZdVP1lLxlY7h1HJB%2bBipV0s9I6JVRPE7oJFDd1PB/BxoMmgkiir6aSpjWSBJFaRGBIZQdwbdsMfrzNMszqakno6GipZY42jk9tGFWQhtrr22vbnCr2wUoKOOb2qv/ALSEXHK6bX8b3%2bO2DbCjOMhHY1vz%2bJalqKg9TdlFPHCGqklEXRQyRy6AUEoAKKQfIIPP4wbk9Q0oZJI6%2bd5ndDMfYxgBbHURfuL7fIvxxhXr6pqtr20QxsUjiB2Qf9%2bT3xGX1CU8yyPAkxHCuTp/Y74Sri46ZgpND1jC9Xks9a08uYZgJXfqmT2aaS2mwst9hbxbnxgZNryypSty55IirE08yENq7fgbXuDe99xinVzyVFRLPM2qRrjiwAA2AGMyupaGZYT9dPOwWSMmwN9r%2bCL3vjgUA2JsgVWIHY9pb/sWbRpEYc0q10W0rr%2b23FtrDfgDxgRLLJM%2bqV2drBbsbmw4GCGaUy00rwA3MTsgYAC4B5t8898DMVCYET//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics officially launches the Ambassador Program!","path":"/blog/robonomics-officially-launches-the-ambassador-program/","date":"April 17, 2022","description":"The Robonomics team invites everyone who is passionate about the idea of the project, and is ready to contribute to the development and promotion of Robonomics in the international arena for cooperation.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\nimport RoboList from '~/components/blocks/List.vue'\nimport RoboListItem from '~/components/blocks/ListItem.vue'\n\nOver the past years, the Robonomics project has been developing dynamically.

Now, we will provide details of the work we have already performed within the task list","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\nThe Robonomics parachain was launched in January of this year, and our first publicly available progress report was published on January 18th [in a blog post](https://robonomics.network/blog/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/). Now, we will provide details of the work we have already performed within the task list as specified in the roadmap on Github: [Tracking issue for Robonomics Parachains on Kusama Launch #145](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/issues/145).\n\n## About the most important things in the work of the Robonomics parachain on Kusama in 2 months\n\n- The parachain is stable and has processed the first million extrinsics. The current network of collators also remains open with approximately [80 collators](https://telemetry.parachain.robonomics.network/#list/Robonomics). Anyone can [become a Robonomics collator](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/how-to-launch-the-robonomics-collator/) and receive rewards for preparing parachain block candidates and passing them to the Kusama validators.\n\n- [In the release 1.8.2](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.8.2), the sudo function was removed. The change was accepted by the parachain at the block [347,918](https://robonomics.subscan.io/block/347918). This means that the project development team no longer has the administrative functions of managing the parachain anymore.\n\n- [The technical committee](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/techcomm) completed the first update of the network protocol through the on-chain governance mechanism. In just 2 months, the technical committee has processed around 40 requests, such as exodus events, treasury proposals and runtime upgrades.\n\n- [Starting from the release 1.8.0](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.8.0), the Robot-as-a-service function is fully available. Using this function, you can combine the technical and economic parameters of launching an IoT device.\n\n- [The mechanism of IoT subscriptions in the Robonomics parachain](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/get-subscription/) has passed the stage of the first applications in real work scenarios. Now it has become the main functionality of the parachain, which the Robonomics developers plan to offer to home infrastructure owners.\n\n- The Winter school was suspended on February 24th. After 3 weeks, the developers decided to abandon the continuation of the school as an event. The Winter School lessons have been redesigned as an introductory Robonomics course, which will be available online 24/7 during 2022 from anywhere in the world. The course will be published on the [robonomics.academy website](https://robonomics.academy/) by the end of March.\n\n- An additional 1 XRT for crowdoan campaign participants who have a pioneer card [is available through the Robonomics dapp](https://robonomics.app/#/bonus-for-pioneer).\n\n## Parachain statistics for 2 months\n\nYou can find most of the statistics yourself on the Subscan.io block explorer at: [robonomics.subscan.io](https://robonomics.subscan.io)\n\n![Parachain statistics on Subscan.io](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/robonomics-parachain-subscan.jpg)\n\n### The Robonomics parachain processed 1 million transactions\n\nIt is more correct to say [extrinsics](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-protocol-info#extrinsics), but still we will sometimes use such assumptions for simplicity.\n\n![extrinsics for Robonomics](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/montly-extrinsics.png)\n\nThe daily load on the parachain today is from 10 to 25 thousands transactions per day. The datalog() function is mainly used to remotely collect data from IoT devices. Also, since February, the Robonomics developers have started using parachain IoT subscriptions for the first Robonomics scenarios of which we have been preparing for the past 2 years.\n\n![The daily load on the parachain today](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/robonomics-parachain-transactions.jpg)\n\nThe number of full Robonomics nodes that transmit to [the publicly available parachain telemetry service](https://telemetry.parachain.robonomics.network/#list/Robonomics) has doubled from 40 to 80 full network nodes. Anyone can [become a Robonomics collator](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/how-to-launch-the-robonomics-collator/) and receive rewards for preparing parachain block candidates and passing them to the Kusama validators.\n\n### The first Robonomics users\n\nAlready in early February, we had confidence that the Robonomics parachain was ready to accept it’s first users. Engaging early adopters always involves putting a lot of emphasis on training and helping out with whatever situation an early version user gets into. It is also a search for the most patient and responsive people who are interested in the technologies we use. Yes, there are always a few of them, and it is difficult to find them in more numbers than a couple of friends and work colleagues, but this is precisely the task we face in 2022. By creating a community of web3 + IoT power users ready to experiment for the sake of education, we will be able to ensure the exponential growth of the project in 2023-2024.\n\nThe main thing we want to do to attract the first users is to develop some training courses in 2022 that will not only be useful in terms of acquiring skills, but will also be interesting to complete.\n\nOf course, the Robonomics developers plan to organize contests and encourage the community for being active. However, we still believe that creativity/enthusiasm is stronger than the learning material we could provide. It's cool when, in the process of learning, you can try [to go through a black mirror](https://blackmirror.robonomics.academy/#/) and, while the QR code on the screen changes, remember any episode of the series of the same name or a scene from Philip K. Dick's book \"Ubik\", in which the main character quarrels with the door, to which he owes a couple of coins... In general, one of the main tasks of the team is to maintain a creative approach to user education in the future.\n\n![](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/blackmirror-lesson.jpg)\n\nThe Winter school [was suspended on February 24th](https://twitter.com/EnsRationis/status/1496885398404059136). Fortunately, you can still try the first lesson now! To do this, follow the link: [https://blackmirror.robonomics.academy/#/](https://blackmirror.robonomics.academy/#/)\n\nThose who have already completed the first lesson of the School in February may notice that the address of (D)app has changed. Now the lesson is available on the robonomics.academy domain, and soon all 5 lessons that we planned to conduct in the event format of the last week of February will be available online 24/7 in the Robonomics introductory course format. We will tell you about this separately.\n\n### The Robonomics releases on GitHub\n\nOver the past 2 weeks, there have been many releases of the Robonomics parachain client. The most relevant at the time of this writing is [1.8.4](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases).\n\n[Building the Robonomics parachain client](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/how-to-build-collator-node/) on Ubuntu 21.10 and running without any difficulties:\n\n![Building the Robonomics parachain client](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/building-client-for-robonomics-parachain.jpg)\n\nIn addition to system updates in releases, it is important to note the following improvements:\n\n- [Release 1.8.0](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.8.0) - added pallet liability, which allows you to fully implement the Robot-as-a-Service model and launch an IoT device with the transfer of technical and economic information in an atomic form.\n- [Release 1.8.2](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.8.2) - the superuser (sudo) has been removed from the Robonomics parachain. Already today, the Robonomics parachain does not have the possibility of direct control by the developers.\n\nYou can get acquainted with all the changes in the Robonomics parachain client at the link: [https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases)\n\n## The first stage of the roadmap 2022 is 90% completed\n\nBy the end of Q1 2022, the project team has completed almost all [the tasks to implement the basic functionality of the parachain](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/issues/145), and several Robonomics scenarios that previously worked only in test mode are already at the pilot stage.\n\n### The main task of Q2 2022 - XCM integrations\n\nAs you can see from [the Tracking issue for Robonomics Parachains on Kusama Launch #145](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/issues/145), the first part of the tasks has an item related to [XCMP](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/XCMP/index.html) implementation. We implemented the first tests with messaging between 2 instances of the Robonomics parachain during [a master class in St. Petersburg in the fall of 2020](https://youtu.be/zCH7RuIHEMg). It is the case howeever, that in past 1.5 years XCMP has undergone many changes, and now it is more correct to say [XCM (Cross-Consensus Message)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain).\n\nGavin Wood introduced the first version of XCM in the fall of 2021. XCM is well covered in three articles on medium:\n\n- [XCM: The Cross-Consensus Message Format](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format-3b77b1373392)\n- [XCM Part II: Versioning and Compatibility](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-part-ii-versioning-and-compatibility-b313fc257b83)\n- [XCM Part III: Execution and Error Management](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-part-iii-execution-and-error-management-ceb8155dd166)r\n\nAlready in February, we began to refine the Robonomics parachain in order to implement the first integration within the Kusama ecosystem. Our first task in this direction is integration with the Statemine parachain. This integration will allow users to use any statemine tokens to pay according to the Robot-as-a-Service model, for example, [when remotely controlling a telescope in the Atacama Desert](http://telescope.merklebot.com/) or to pay for items in a vending machine with tokens anywhere in the world.\n\nIn addition to integration with Statemine, plans for Q2 include:\n\n- Integration with Karura to add XRT/kUSD liquidity pool.\n- Integration with Moonriver to manage IoT devices using arbitrary solidity contracts.\n- Studying the technology of bridges between Ethereum and Kusama using the example of Darwinia.\n\nWe will describe each integration scenario separately based on the results of testing in Rococo, Westend or other sandboxes where Karura, Moonriver, Darwinia parachains have their own test versions.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nThere is complete chaos around us now, but the project team marked our trajectory for the web3 universe long ago - we publish the results of our work on the Internet so that experiments can be repeated anywhere in the world, because apart from open source code and access to the blockchain, you do not need anything more. Of course, life in the world of web3 is not so easy when it comes to a lot of details, but we can handle it. As engineers, we can imagine the consequences of militarization in the 21st century. The best thing that we all can do, with the current geopolitcal situations in mind, is to personally participate in peaceful projects and create as much open source software as possible for the tasks of ordinary people. Over the past year, our efforts have launched such projects as: an educational program for [remote control of the robotic dog Boston Dynamics](https://spot-sdk.education/); [remote observation of the starry sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up8hESnXnaY) from the most suitable place for this on the planet Earth - the Atacama Desert; [civil sensor network for monitoring the quality of the urban environment](https://airalab.org/en/air-monitoring) in the industrial city of Togliatti; [monitoring of water quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iCkdF2UJmo) in the canals of St. Petersburg. This year we will be focusing on smart home scenarios so you can [manage your home IoT infrastructure without the help of clouds](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/home-assistant-begin/).\n\nWe will share more with you in the next roadmap updates.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.2dda027cdaaedf053f61bff5d81e8041.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.2dda027cdaaedf053f61bff5d81e8041.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.2dda027cdaaedf053f61bff5d81e8041.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.2dda027cdaaedf053f61bff5d81e8041.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-4b6d9c736c1efdd34d0366199e23bc26'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-4b6d9c736c1efdd34d0366199e23bc26)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMBBAUABgf/xAAvEAACAgAEBAMGBwAAAAAAAAABAgMRAAQhMQUSE0EiUWEGFHGBkcEjJEKh0vDx/8QAGAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDBAH/xAAhEQACAgAFBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRBBIhMZEDE0FRYf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A8KWPLy%2bFSyvt49L%2beKs0TROVbDiAVaxV7kYsLOBDFIYo5JLKL1RzCxWpHfQjfyxY64K6bos8F9nc1xHllkHu%2bV3MjjUj0H32xnnLJNxI5fI9WdGk5I6W3fWhQG5J2xqZWXjXHYczlYS%2bZCgSModU5Rdelj0w/L%2bz/tDwv83Fk2geHmbrCZAUob76fHDRy2r2LYyeG7UenhIu/Llu36paJcvg64Iz1umdDdWe2GzwKkYZS2wNMNwe%2bNluD8bzxXiXuvUaW5zIZEtgdeYreg3N1ihxGPMZaR8rmxDDIKLKut2LBsWNbGFdXoY4pszccxLAA0CD6jEYALF2eRQSxNUNyfTDcwRFAkVgsD4q11vX7D5YOWTpiolEZbTmXf64pSUGoDb98A7kaCxRWB0VBLML5ZRsT/nn54BssAjeG28unJY301H9rCBm6KnoxmiTu3ftv64I527/AAEF9w7/AMsZ3Gd6WQpjTDGihSoJB8TlZRQ328u2JlijhhLNEshB3IlXS9tcIGbHKVaBGJFElnvb44EZrQh4lcEAUzN2774Mk/oUxDEFiQAATsO2IwUjB3LKgQH9Iuh9cDi6HP/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics parachain on Kusama: first week's report","path":"/blog/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/","date":"January 18, 2022","description":"Since the launch of the Robonomics parachain, we have managed to complete a fairly large range of tasks, and for that, my special thanks goes out to everyone who broke away early from nice meals, champagne, and trips to friends & family on January 2nd and 3rd :) The below information is what I personally participated in and what I want to tell you about.","content":"import KusamaSlotBanner from '~/components/blocks/KusamaSlotBanner.vue'\nimport Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Basic infrastructure of the Robonomics Parachain\n\nThe Robonomics parachain [was launched on 9th January 2022](https://twitter.com/EnsRationis/status/1480139879057174530). Upon launching, [release 1.4  of \"Kusama Parachain Launch\"](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.4.0) – which can be used to launch a [collator](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-collator) – was posted on GitHub.\n\n[Together with p2p.org](https://economy.p2p.org/p2p-validator-and-robonomics-announce-partnership-for-launch-of-parachains-on-kusama/), we launched the first of the parachain collators. During the first week of parachain operation, an open network of [40+ collators](https://telemetry.parachain.robonomics.network/#/Robonomics) emerged. \n\nLet me remind you that the role of the collator is to collect parachain block candidates and transfer them for validation to the Kusama Relay chain’s network of validator nodes. Parahcain collators perform calculations on the current block, and try to propagate the formed block as soon as possible among parachain collators. In return, the collator receives a small, guaranteed amount of XRT as a reward for the computations spent plus 50% of all commissions generated in the block. \n\nTwo [days into the parachain launch](https://discord.com/channels/803947358492557312/895723411278557227/930224374630473738), a contest was held amongst the community members to see who could set up the first collators. \n\nOn the third day, [Subscan switched](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1480833207834664960) swapped over the Robonomics parachain block explorer from the testnet (Frontier Network) to the mainnet.\n\nThe Robonomics wiki was updated tp provide community-tested instructions for building and running a parachain collator, including:\n\n- [how to build a collator node from source](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/how-to-build-collator-node/)\n- [how to launch the Robonomics collator](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/how-to-launch-the-robonomics-collator/)\n\nIssues related to the work of collators can be discussed:\n\n- on Discord: https://discord.gg/hBJS7uE2NC\n- or on Element: https://app.element.io/#/room/#robonomics:matrix.org\n\n## Runtime Parachain for today\n\nFor everyone who is not yet familiar with the concept of runtime, I would advise you to read this article first: https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/frame/ \n\nThe current runtime structure of Robonomics is as follows:\n\n<Card>\n\n### Robonomics Parachain\n\n#### Cyber physical system functions\n- Digital twin\n- Launch\n- Datalog\n- Robot-as-a-service\n\n#### IoT Subscription\n- Subscription auction\n- Staking\n\n#### Onchain governance\n- Treasury\n- Tech comm\n- Democracy\n\n#### Token\n- Balances\n- Transaction \n- Multisig\n- Vesting\n\n#### Network maintenance\n- Lighthouse \n- Identity\n\n</Card>\n\nYou can read the technical descriptions of the runtime modules specific to the Robonomics parachain at the following link: https://crates.robonomics.network/pallet_robonomics_datalog/index.html \n\nAdditionally, we will also talk separately about Robonomics parachain modules as we approach the Winter Developer School 2022, which will be held in February.\n\n## Establishment of the Parachain Technical Committee\n\n![the Parachain Technical Committee](./images/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/1-parachain-technical-committee.png)\n\nThe six project developers who most frequently participated in frontier network development were added into the [Parachain Technical Committee](https://wiki.polkadot.network/ru-RU/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee). \n\nThe Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda, which are fast-tracked for voting and implementation. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n\n## Parachain Treasury replenished and good to go\n\nSimilar to how the Kusama Network [Treasury](https://wiki.polkadot.network/ru-RU/docs/learn-treasury) works, the Robonomics developers plan to use over 400,000 XRT to support the community. Examples of requests to the Kusama Treasury are available here kusama.polkassembly.io.\n\nInstructions on how to submit a request to the Robonomics Treasury and details regarding priority areas for funding will be discussed separately in subsequent blog articles.\n\n![Robonomics Treasury](./images/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/2-Treasury.png)\n\nThe Treasury is available at: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/treasury\n\n## 1/12th of crowdloan reward for participants of the 4th crowdloan campaign distributed and the launch of the vesting module\n\nRobonomics Developers have completed the distribution of 1/12th of the crowdloan rewards to the balances of crowdloan contributors. You can check the balance using Developer > Chain state > system.account():FrameSystemAccountInfo\n\n![Robonomics Chain state] (./images/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/3-chain-state.png)\n\nThe free value as shown in the screenshot corresponds to 1,102,517,448 Wn ≈ 1.1 XRT (the free balance is displayed in micro XRT 10<sup>−6</sup> )  and this is the free balance available for transfer within the network.\n\nThe vesting module was also enabled in the latest runtime update. This week 11/12 bounties are being sent out, which will also show up in Developer > Chain state > system.account():FrameSystemAccountInfo under \"miscFrozen\".\n\nThe full crowdloan contribution reward will be unlocked linearly within the next 11 months. The amount available for unlocking can be seen in the “vested” field of the Accounts page.\n\n![The amount available for unlocking](./images/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/4-amount-available.png)\n\nTowards the end of January, we will provide more information regarding claiming an additional 1 XRT per 1 KSM contributed during the crowdloan for those who own a Robonomics Pioneer NFT.  Robonomics Developers will report this separately on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).\n\n## Migrating XRT from the frontier network\n\nOver the past six months, we have continued to test the functionality of the parachain in the [frontier network](https://robonomics.network/blog/robonomics-frontier/). In the first week of the life of the parachain in Kusama, developers stopped the work on the frontier network, and distributed parachain balances to Kusama.\n\n![frontier network](./images/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/5-frontier-network.png)\n\nAs you can see in the screenshot, the last block of the Robonomics parachain on the frontier network relay chain is #1,046,628, and the frontier network stopped producing blocks 143 hours ago. \n\nYou can check your balance at the time of the last block in the frontier network using the link (Developer > Chain state > system.account: AccountInfo): \nhttps://parachain.robonomics.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmain.frontier .rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/chainstate \n\nIt should be noted that the transfer of balances was a multi-layered task:\n- To begin with, free and staked tokens were collected.\n- Later, staking rewards were collected, which have not yet been received by users (not claimed).\n- Rewards were also added to them and requested for withdrawal but not withdrawn from staking.\n- 11/12th of the crowdloan rewards for participating in the 1st crowdloan campaign (“Plan B” rewards) were deducted from user balances (see below).\n- Received values were added up and sent to one developer owned address for distribution.\n- 11/12th of the crowdloan rewards for participants of the 4th crowdloan campaign were sent into vesting for 11 months.\n\nThus, the initial balance of participants on Kusama parachain should consist of:\n- XRT Tokens transferred via the exodus bridge.\n- Staking rewards generated in the lifetime of the parachain which existed on the frontier network relay chain.\n- Collators rewards\n- 1/12th of the crowdloan contribution reward from participation in the 1st crowdloan campaign (“Plan B” rewards).\n- 1/12th of the crowdloan contribution rewards from participation in the 4th (winning) crowdloan campaign\n\n## XRT staking on Kusama Parachain\n\nIn the second update of the Robonomics parachain, the XRT staking module was included.\n\n![Robonomics dapp](./images/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/6-Robonomics-dapp.png)\n*An example of working with the staking section in Robonomics dapp*\n\nXRT staking is available on the Robonomics dapp at the following link: https://robonomics.app/#/staking/ \n\nThe staking reward is approximately 10% per year.\n\nFor participants in the 4th crowdloan campaign, the Robonomics developers have increased the staking reward to 50%. Please note that this percentage of staking reward is limited only to the amount of XRT generated via your participation in the 4th crowdloan campaign.\n\nIt should be noted that the full implementation of the [autonomous parachain life cycle](https://robonomics.network/blog/automating-kusama-crowdloan-campaigns/) will change the constant values of the staking reward to variables that adapt to the size of the KSM staking reward on the Relay chain. This topic will be further discussed with more detail in the Robonomics Whitepaper 2022. After its publication, we will begin to change the network.\n\n## The most important lies ahead!\n\nRobonomics application scenarios [are already moving from the frontier network to the Kusama parachain](https://twitter.com/EnsRationis/status/1481900111856906240). Towards the end of January, we will announce the dates of the Robonomics demo week of IoT projects which are ready to present their solutions based on the Kusama parachain. \n\nFollow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) for updates, and remember that Robonomics does not aim to be a unicorn amongst crypto projects until we pave a sustainable development path for user growth. During 2022, dozens of interesting web3 application scenarios in the field of IoT await us.

Kanaria are also the precursor to RMRK’s upcoming metaverse - [Kanaria: Skybreach](https://url.rmrk.app/meta).\n\nRobonomics has committed to supporting the addition of RMRK’s pallets into their runtime, thereby integrating natively with the world’s most advanced NFT logic (the addition is still subject to community governance vote). This integration allows RMRK 2.0 NFTs to natively exist on Robonomics' upcoming parachain, and has implications for the extension and exploration of how NFTs built on the RMRK standard can be utilized in IoT applications and complex robotics.\n\nAs one of the first projects engaging and building within the Polkadot ecosystem, Robonomics offers a platform to build Web3 robotic solutions and applications for use cases within supply chain, payments systems, production, digital passports, and *robots-as-a-service*.\n\nRMRK on the other hand will reward the top 500 crowdloaners [participating in Robonomics crowdloan](https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot/). These champions will be airdropped a special Kanaria-compatible item - a child NFT that can be equipped onto one’s Kanaria bird, and may bestow advantages in [RMRK’s metaverse](https://url.rmrk.app/meta).\n\nYou do not have to have a Kanaria bird to get this bonus item, but you do have to be in the top 500 contributors.\n\n## About Robonomics\n\nRobonomics is an open-source platform for IoT applications. They support a new generation of internet technologies (web3) that implements the exchange of technical and economic information in the form of atomic transactions between user applications, IoT services, and complex robotics.\n\nThe Robonomics platform provides tools for working with the robot economy network. Robonomics allow designers of smart cities and industry 4.0 zones to build trust among the autonomous robots services, provide direct user access via dapp for ordering products from autonomous factories and services of urban sensor networks. This in turn allows Robonomics and it’s users to put in place a decentralized system that globally monitors the activities of cyber physical systems.\n\n\n## About RMRK\n\n[RMRK](https://rmrk.app/) is a team spearheading the development of the RMRK protocol for creating highly composeable “NFT legos” using NFTs on the [Kusama](https://kusama.network/).\n\nAmong others, RMRK brings the following features to the NFT table:\n\n* emoting to NFTs on chain\n* custom burn messages\n* NFTs owning NFTs\n* NFTs that have conditional rendering (if this, show that)\n* NFTs that have slots for upgrades\n* NFTs that have multi-resources (i.e. contain both code for a game and high-res cover art)\n* NFTs that can be governed as DAOs\n\nIt thereby far exceeds what the current ERC721 / ERC1155 standards and their derivatives can do.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.96fd53e35d136063f1cd2a1fedb9c087.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.96fd53e35d136063f1cd2a1fedb9c087.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.96fd53e35d136063f1cd2a1fedb9c087.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.96fd53e35d136063f1cd2a1fedb9c087.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-da6944bf3b82fb62d8ae432d21831d36'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-da6944bf3b82fb62d8ae432d21831d36)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAQUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgADBAUHAv/EACoQAAICAQMDAgYDAQAAAAAAAAECAxEEAAUhEhMxBiIUFUFRYXEyQ1LR/8QAFwEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwIDBP/EACcRAAEDAgUDBQEAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMEEQUhMUFhEpHwIlGBwdFx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDCgCSABZPAGnRjzNkjHWNjOW6BGByW8V%2b9dYIJyVKoWK2eCBX5540SbjsONHtT5ULTGUdtwzSddqeDwPyDpKqK1sEjWO3%2bc/O6zMiL2kjZC0qNFI6SKUdCVZWFEEeQdXWy%2bn8/KzcYzYuXDA5DCUY7ODVEUB5/f01XGFp9yMdGPrf%2b32UD978DUzb8DLf1HjbbHOiTHJWJWM9Rg9VWGuq/I86ue8mPWxsoxkCUDlaZmbbk4zSEwzmBP7WiKAj70fGoV81on2j0vkbpgif5hBGCzL0O9%2bDVg3R0s/038vfEiycuCWOafotKFWpHDE0D7RweDY/ejlg6j0psrMYiooi53rLdQBnbc/GpQuhDlgnuK/yA5rXRBUkMCCPIIo6MvT3p34FIMlCJ2LvDLA4I6ozam65siiP%2bc6Hd/wAPFwNzkx8J53RP595gzK18ix51kZVsfM6Eaj61UcOxltdIGMGRF7%2bbcrHu6oxe0E9xbqZvv9gfxogw/UMHyR8DKgUu8LxdwC6IYPGa8f7U/sH6aGdLSXU4fFUtAffI3uDv5tpkEMxTujNwAf6pfXHkZ6o0wx8ZmVDIylgijjqIHJofQedEA2fZjuISDeM/tLKBD3NscM4BHuoHi/NfQUPOhTUzFzMr4qA/FZFh1APdbjkfnVz4yGWabWHH4oR5yA8rYZsHBjx3eDcshyFLKPhHVWNcC74/eqSUSSSqGLGMAk23k/atSO/KVK92TpIojqNVpvRwE%2bGAvb0vcT2/ArvE3DbduxDGrZuRKySBZEJjEd1Rq/Ni%2bL1QQFjHb31EkmxzpzS1TFA2IucN1lpMLipZDI0kk%2b9voDnuv//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Automating Crowdloan Campaigns","path":"/blog/automating-kusama-crowdloan-campaigns/","date":"December 8, 2021","description":"The experience and data from the first cohort of teams who have secured crowdloans can now provide a foundation that future teams can build from to better price, and automate the process of securing crowdloans and winning auctions.","content":"import KusamaSlotBanner from '~/components/blocks/KusamaSlotBanner.vue'\n\n\n\nThe initial parachain slot auctions and their associated crowdloans suffered from a first mover disadvantage that caused their prices to be difficult to predict and often too high.  This disadvantage is common in any new market undergoing price discovery, especially markets like the parachain auctions where teams are launching diverse products with diverse needs.\n\nThe experience and data from the first cohort of teams who have secured crowdloans can now provide a foundation that future teams can build from to better price, and automate the process of securing crowdloans and winning auctions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Robonomic core developers will implement an automated oracle beginning with the 4th parachain crowdloan campaign in order to participate in future Kusama parachain slot auctions. This mechanism will allow the robonomics team to automate payment of each future parachain slot lease at renewal.  The robonomics team hopes that this effort will inspire other future teams to use or implement their own automated process to better streamline and reduce the downside risks for teams of the overall slot auction system.\n\n## Parameters currently independently determined by Parachains\n\n> Contribution Cap; Campaign Period; Participant Rewards; Source of Rewards; Distribution of Tokens.\n\nTo mitigate risk and unpredictability for both projects and participants, and to help keep the cost of winning these auctions realistic and in line with their value proposition, we would propose that these aforementioned parameters are evaluated and subsequently determined not independently by Parachains, but by an automated oracle. With application and in due time, we anticipate this oracle could be integrated as a common good parachain on Kusama and eventually Polkadot. \n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOften overlooked in the excitement of these initial Crowdloans and their generous rewards mechanisms, is the reality that winning projects have a 48 week lifespan as a working operating parachain on Kusama before their lease expires and they are required to renew their position. \n\nWith this in mind, we’ve laid out a v1 summary of our automated oracle algorithm and the conditions under which it could be relevant and effective in the context of the larger slot auction protocol. \n\n\n## Autonomous oracle of crowdloan campaigns\n\nSo often, you want to be first, but over time you realize that it's more important to stay in the game. The Polkadot ecosystem is just the kind of place where it doesn't matter whether you are the first or the last, what matters is that there is a \"free chair\" for you. We wonder if in your childhood you played the game [“musical chairs”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_chairs), but we remember it very well from kindergarten.\n\nOf course, there is an important specificity here as well: the parachain slot lease must be extended before the end of the current lease, otherwise, there may be an interruption or complication in parachain services (the parachain will switch to [Pay-as-you-go Parachains](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06),  also known as a parathread, for some time).\n\n![\"Polkadot ecosystem\"](./images/automating-kusama-crowdloan-campaigns/polkadot-ecosystem.jpg)\n\nIn general, it's important to stay in line. Below we will talk about the first version of our proposed algorithm for autonomous calculation of the main parameters of crowdloan campaign oracle. Perhaps we should give it a name, but so far nothing interesting comes to mind.\n\n### Contribution Cap Averaging\n\nWithin this model we would propose that the automated oracle calculates and averages the median cost in KSM required to win each auction from #15 - #29. This resulting averaged cost would be set as the KSM Crowdloan contribution cap for slot #30. \t\t\n\n### Lifespan of a crowdloan campaign\n\nWe assume that one Crowdloan Campaign should aim to collect for 5 weeks. In case of failure, the oracle will have to shift the sample estimate of the median fees from a range of [15-29] auctions to [20-34] and so on, to account for the results of previous auctions. In this way, there will be an automatic setup up to the point of successfully obtaining a slot.\n\n### Evaluation of the reward for each KSM in favour of the crowdloan campaign\n\nThis is the most complex part of the oracle algorithm, requiring the infrastructure of the running parachains. Predicting the cyclically repeating economy of parachains operating for several years now, we remain true to the view that [the reward for crowdloan campaign participants is equal to the lost profit from staking in the Relay chain](https://robonomics.network/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/).\n\nMost importantly, the reward from staking can be autonomously estimated by an oracle with a fairly high degree of accuracy. For example, we can now talk about a lost profit of 0.19 KSM for every 1 KSM during the year. However, the lost revenue metric alone is not enough, since the reward in parachain is offered in the parachain native token. It is due to this that the scheme gets a little more complicated, but not by too much. We assume that the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems will always have price tickers for native parachain tokens. For example, Karura’s $KAR may be such a ticker already this year in the Kusama network. We get that the oracle independently, without help from anyone outside, can: (1) obtain data about the current staking fee in the Relay chain, (2) autonomously obtain data about the price of a native parachain token from the DeFi segment of the ecosystem ticker and, based on that data, make an offer similar to the KSM staking.\n\nThe DOT and KSM holder will split their bag of tokens between staking in the Relay chain and supporting several (maybe several dozen) crowdloan campaigns, based on a desire to keep the reward as it would be if all DOT/KSM were staked, but diversifying the risk of a single token price. Yes, right now the rewards in parachains are more viewed as a percentage of all native tokens, and figures of 20% of total supply don't seem inflated in the community. Although it's hard to imagine a picture where every year 20% of all tokens will be offered just for slot rentals. Still, this is the genesis state at the stage of the first auctions and, again, a normal picture at the start. However, taking current rewards for everyday life for a decade is not a good idea.\n\nThe main criterion for calculating the reward will be the lost profit from staking in the crowdloan campaign of any of the projects and the conversion of this value into the number of native tokens at the current rate. This task can be performed by an autonomous process.\n\n### Reward source and token distribution in parachain\n\nWe propose to implement a mechanism for issuing new tokens in the parachain through the treasury module. In turn, the parachain treasury will distribute new parachain coins among the crowdloan campaign participants on a monthly basis throughout the current slot lease term.\n\n## Closing the loop\n\nAbove, we gave a generalized description of the first version of the oracle algorithm, which is intended to make the Robonomics protocol more viable without direct developer involvement. However, it is even more important to understand the connection between the slot lease in the ecosystem and the target function of the project. In the case of Robonomics, it is a fee to store, update and interact the user with the digital twin of the cyber-physical system. Our goal on the horizon of 3 years is to form a Robonomics segment capable of serving up to 1 million digital twins per month at ~0.25 XRT.\n\nIf the target load is reached, we will have more than $60 million per year in demand for XRT purchases in the marketplace, which will be burned off when the subscription is activated.\n\n(I’ll talk more about the subscription life cycle separately when I publish the next release of Robonomics, dedicated to the subscription auction mechanism). It turns out that the value of XRT will not decline if the number of subscriptions sold for XRT during the year cumulatively exceeds the value that the treasury of parachain will pay according to the oracle of crowdloan campaigns.\n\nIn general, my team and I are on a course to create this scheme, which should make it possible to close the tokenomics of the parachain from the moment the slot is obtained to the moment the lease is renewed. We want to make this process as autonomous of human will as possible, and leave only the token holders and developers to propose improvements to the algorithm through the mechanism of democracy and the parachain technical committee. No handwork in perspective. In the meantime, as always happens with hypotheses, we will still take the first steps manually. Below is how the oracle of the future would work for the 4th crowdloan campaign (roughly).\n\n## The parameters of the fourth crowdloan campaign\n\n<Card>\n\n### Collection limit **47,425.5262 KSM**\n\nBased on fees assessment of the 15th auction, Geshiro\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Duration **5 weeks**\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Remuneration **4.20 XRT**\n\n1 KSM ~ 370$ APR = 19%,<br/>1XRT ~ 17$\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Bonus\n\nPioneer NFT cardholders will receive an extra 1XRT for each KSM\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Distribution rewards **Monthly**\n\nProportionally equal shares for 12 months.

Unfortunately, this led to Robonomics failing to enter the community's shortlist during the first few days of the second round, and thus did not receive much attention. The battle for slots between Calamari, Basilisk Heiko and Altair saw extremely high stakes and unexpected twists (thanks to the auction mechanism with a candle for the special effects during the Heiko vs. Altair battle).\n\n![\"Kusama Crowdloan Timeline\"](./images/kusama-crowdloan-third-wave-details/image2.png)\n\nHow much will Robonomics raise in the third round? Will it be comparable to the first campaign, in the region of 20k - 30k KSM tokens? Or more akin to the results of the second round, around 3k to 10k KSM? Only holders of Kusama Relay Chain tokens know the answer. Most importantly, we expect a reduction in fundraising requirements to win one of the next auctions on the Kusama network.\n\n## Third Robonomics crowdloan\n\n### Parameters\n\nRobonomics developers will publish the KSM crowdloan module on 23 October with the following parameters:\n\n- The start of the crowdloan campaign: 23 Oct 2021\n- For each KSM bonded, you'll get 3.5 XRT over 48 weeks\n- 1.725 XRT will be unlocked within the first month after the Robonomics parachain launch\n- KSM bonders will get the entire reward within one year of XRT staking with an increased APR of up to 100%\n\n### Bonuses\n\n- Extra reward for everyone who bonds the first 6,300 KSM. Get 6 XRT instead of 3.5 XRT in a year\n- Extra reward for Robonomics Pioneer NFT holders who bond the first 27,000 KSM. Get 6 XRT instead of 3.5 XRT in a year\n\nCrowdloan rewards will be distributed in the Robonomics parachain. There won't be an option to get rewards in ERC-20 XRT.\n\n## Real-world use cases on Kusama!\n\nThe main use-case that Robonomics can bring to the Kusama ecosystem are small but fully-fledged scenarios for the application of Polkadot technologies in the real economy.\n\nDuring [Polkadot Decoded 2021](https://youtu.be/rbjOmJmilAg) and during the second crowdloan campaign, in an article titled ['Polkadot for the IoT market...'](/blog/polkadot-for-iot-with-robonomics/), I already talked about the services that we created during the experiments of 2017 - 2019 and that we are ready to launch on the Kusama network in the coming months. In this article, I will only briefly describe some of the more complete services again.\n\n### Civic Sensor Map\n\nFor the third year running, the non-profit organisation Airalab Rus has been conducting an experiment to build a decentralised sensor map of air and water pollution in an industrial city on the Volga with a population of 700,000 people (the city of Tolyatti). At the moment, the network of sensors covers almost the entire city, and also measures not only particles, but also more complex chemical compounds such as formaldehyde and ammonia. In 2019, the hardware/software framework for monitoring water was selected for demonstration at the IoT World Congress in Barcelona, and recognised as one of the most unusual and interesting solutions in the field of the Internet of Things. In December 2019, the project was announced as part of the next **UN Climate Change Conference**, and in 2021 it **received additional funding from the European Union** to connect sensors certified according to local legislation.\n\nThe Civic Sensor Network is an example from the world of Web3, in which technology allows us to overcome the most common problems related to non-commercial activity, such as the inability to give one person super admin rights. \n\nYou can learn more about the project on the Airalab Rus: https://airalab.org/en/air-monitoring\n\n### Digital Twins for Smart Leasing\n\nMerklebot, which uses Robonomics technologies, has implemented two robot-as-a-service scenarios over the past 12 months, one in the spirit of Industry 4.0 and another in the field of EdTech.\n\nThere is an interesting new use case in Robonomics - For four months already, an industrial manipulator has been operating in a manufacturing facility in the United States with an hourly wage. At the end of each shift, the manipulator updates its digital twin instance stored in the parachain. Based on the changes in the digital twin, an invoice is issued for the use of the manipulator structured as IoT-enabled leasing.\n\nThus, we can say that Kusama will be an example of a fintech solution from Web3 for the new Industry 4.0. Someday the public will understand the significance of this use case, and we will see a boom of DeFi in this modern industry!\n\n### Meet Spot, our Robodog\n\nThis summer, the first group of engineers learned to work with our own Spot as part of the spot-sdk.education course. By the end of September, anyone anywhere in the world can take our course and get their hands on the robodog from Boston Dynamics. The course is developed by robotics specialists from the ITMO University in St. Petersburg with Merklebot acting as the local operator in the San Francisco Bay Area lab, the home of our Spot.\n\nAccessing Spot is organised with the use of two parachains, Robonomics and Statemine. Logs from the students taking the course will be recorded on the Robonomics parachain, while the Statemine parachain is being used to replace user accounts with unique access tokens that students will receive after paying for their course.\n\n### Distributed Sky\n\nThis project is related to drone flight regulation: registration of pilots, drones, flight restricted zones and route announcements. The main goal of the proof-of-concept was to demonstrate that blockchain can be used to announce and register flight routes, mitigating the risk of dispatching errors. Such systems can be used as a base for transport and delivery systems for automated vehicles. While implementing decentralised identifiers for pilots and UAVs is not so complex (blockchain is a DID and SSI system by default), storing information about geo-zones and their polygons, and checking intersections in one transaction was a difficult task. As a result, a kind of 'geo-index', similar to spatial indexes used in SQL databases, was implemented in runtime logic. The proof-of-concept code allows the REGULATORs to register PILOT accounts, and PILOT accounts to register UAVs and announce UAV routes in blockchain. More info: https://mixbytes.io/blog/mixbytes-robonomics-collaboration-report\n\n### Digital Passports for IoT Systems\n\nTwo projects – one is from New Zealand – are using the parachain for recording data about production manufacturing. In one case data about the content of substances in the ground on farms is collected, and data about the final assembly of medical equipment is collected in the second.\n\nBoth scenarios would help the Kusama network to prove itself as a registry for global production distributors.\n\n## Roadmap for the development of the Robonomics parachain in the Kusama network Q4 2021 - Q2 2022\n\nToday, the Robonomics parachain is undergoing a process of further development and testing within an up-to-date copy of Kusama supported by the developers called Frontier Network, which in turn will significantly reduce the time needed to implement these updates after launch on Kusama. Also, all the balances of parachain users in the Frontier Network will be transferred to the Robonomics parachain managed by Kusama as soon as possible.\n\nBy mid-September, the developers had implemented [updates 1.1 Staking and 1.2 Treasury and Technical Committee](https://robonomics.network/blog/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/). In the coming weeks, Robonomics will be ready for the release of 1.3 RWS, which will allow the launch of a full cycle of XRT tokenomics in the parachain for issuing RWS subscriptions. RWS subscriptions are a unique mechanism based on the ability of developers to build their own communication protocol in a shared security environment. RWS will introduce blockchain technology to the IoT market using a familiar subscription model for users, guaranteeing priority processing of transactions in each block. This will protect IoT devices that need to update the state of their digital counterparts to display information in the users' application regularly and predictably over time. An article titled 'Update 1.3 RWS' will be published at the end of October.\n\nThus, the updated roadmap for the development of the Robonomics parachain for the period of slot leasing will look like this:\n\n### Part 1: Establishing Core Functionality\n\nThree months after the launch of the Robonomics parachain, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionality that's been in development in the past couple of years, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n- **Done! Genesis state: (week 0)** Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collator reward systems.\n- **Done! Update 1.1** Staking and allowing transfers (week 0 - 1). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with 10% APR for all token holders and 50% for Crowdloan participants.\n- **Done! Update 1.2** Treasury and Technical Committee. Will allow a share of DAO funds to be transferred from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n- **Current process... Update 1.3** RWS (week 2 - 3). Will allow use of IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n- **Update 1.4** Robot-as-a-service (week 4 - 6). Will allow implementation of a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n- **Update 1.5** XCMP Functionality and Robobank (week 8 - 10). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n- **Update 1.6** Democracy and Remove Sudo (week 11 - 13). Developers won't have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the Technical Committee or a vote by parachain native token holders.\n\n### Part 2: Launch Services Based on Robonomics R&D\n\nThe second part of the roadmap is designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics R&D projects.\n\n- **Globally available digital passports for products.** By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the products produced, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case has already been implemented as a pilot at a company that produces drones. It is used for quality control during packaging with video recording\n- **Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics.** We'll demonstrate the how you can use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device using the example of two robots controlled by the Robonomics parachain in two different industries. The first use case is an educational programme based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog Spot. The second is an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n- **Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits.** It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of a household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n- **Fault-tolerant civic sensor network.** A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or company to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian's industrial cities, Tolyatti.\n- **Self-driving cars and a drone traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas.** This will allow a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes be managed by public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n- **Ecosystem integration updates.** We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem's features.\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for 48 weeks of existence on the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain. This is our vision for the future of Robonomics, as a complete segment of the Polkadot infrastructure specifically intended for working with IoT devices.\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nKusama is an experimental network, and the main reason it is worth participating in any activity surrounding this network is the desire to be involved in a large experiment. When deciding whether you will help Robonomics during the second crowdloan campaign or not, the only question you should be asking yourself is: do I want to see the functionality of putting IoT devices from the real world under the control of the Kusama network in the near future? If the answer is yes, then you are as crazy as we are. You want to change the world, so welcome on board!\n\n\n\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-notification.png'\" :link=\"'https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics'\">\n\n### Join our Twitter\n\nStay tuned and follow updates\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.a9893e28990bd2f815a2b9f921f9d71e.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.a9893e28990bd2f815a2b9f921f9d71e.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.a9893e28990bd2f815a2b9f921f9d71e.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.a9893e28990bd2f815a2b9f921f9d71e.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-8d75cf3b872c912db3b13c18d3f83c08'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-8d75cf3b872c912db3b13c18d3f83c08)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2b1k9yP0GiibOniPjnpAQ3HdVa0t1yAaoizxXg1p7HwWvrrBinksY6W1bIuFS30gCZ3iSZAG4P6VW3c8a4QR3BGi/Oqa29nAY8VhTTlPJ%2bPyQeRSVeBYvUc7mUSUpaZgIU64oX7ygsWeOBQrm/PnSbKVOmgZWO2Leazc7qYrQgQ4khq356WHLoN%2bytZPb7ceT/bXv%2bzIqA39RPLPUFdXVGc%2bJHYdub/xo/3d6WZ7Zu14O9G5%2bLkxVvhChDKj7CySKpQoiwU8ef050KuS9z7sx5ZbjyJseOEhRaZugkK6QSB4HVX/ADRVtpBDyGHEUp6gIDgjT5qb9NdpYDNOz5GfySxBjr9plEdSWXHz3u1pVQrxXc%2bNT3rv6VY7Y2Kweb27NkycPlE0ESukuNqKQsfJIAIIvxxXm9aHoztDC52FlMjuKXMEeE4223DjEILylhR5V3AHT2A/nqz/AFZhSN9bUx%2bNxMVMdOGaUoNvOUfaQ2QjpPkiiDf31wAu2x6NtiQYZuBtPJH7Z96T%2bZW1km1cubt2X/P5/Kl021lW8c%2b81KSpUOSnoc6e6fsRopZl4WMv6peWW%2bkHqDZsknuLHkg/fVea71K1lXLSlV7VocbqHoqoe2r6d11TtzwRtO8Gaktw5Q5fJLkdJQ2AEtpPcJH%2b9R7X5qLBPI4Bq9Y63cGwmTmoDDhIQ7IbQojvRUBoAl235pDJyGuM1%2b6ZJkmmg3HjUT/TKfgH1Ji4XHwnJcZloflrQCsWo2VWSbJPN6WHC5aXhZ6JmPcCH0AhJUkKAsEXR4vnjTHepeRegbNzrMbpAei%2b0okXSSsA1/EcaWI6sur46WrulVgET%2bNZ74cy3y8IPdbU0mZ/viKYf0%2b3fk93tvTsuiJ77LyGgY7Ib6uLsgcXqx21BMLIrI4ER0k/0HVUfhsjtSRIbfT1tqk9rrkN2Do%2b9a82dlbW68bGQ45kOuIVOrJCApBHUB5PJ1EdaxcNbPSdJDMkiANMDV7z9p48VWjpN271Rs5SAitB7zJA9uSfNf/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Update to Version 1.2: Staking, Tech Committee and Treasury","path":"/blog/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/","date":"September 17, 2021","description":"The project developers have implemented 2 important changes in the operation of the Robonomics parachain. The first is the inclusion of XRT staking, and the second is the launch of the first on-chain governance mechanisms.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Update 1.1: Staking\n\n### Theory\n\nDecentralized PoS networks ensure their security by locking the funds of the validators and all token holders on the network who participate in the selection of the validator pool. To reward validators and token holders, an analogous PoW reward model is usually used, based on the inflation + all commission fees in the block. This is how NPoS is implemented in Polkadot/Kusama.\n\n> Notably, both Ethereum and Polkadot include additional conditions for their reward models. Setting inflation targets, dividing the commission fees into several directions, and even burning a certain percentage of the commission fees are additional settings that both mature and newer networks are experimenting with in their implementations.\n\nParachains do not need staking in their core functionality. Parachains are secured by Relay Chain validators. This is a shared security model where the projects compete for slots during auctions.\n\n#### Reinventing Staking\n\nParachains that want to take advantage of the \"wisdom of the crowd\" and assign tasks to the community need to reinvent staking. At Robonomics, that's what we did. The staking architecture in the Robonomics parachain is unique and specific to the blockchain issues that we solve for the IoT market. We offer two ways to pay for the basic functionality of smart devices: per transaction or by monthly subscription.\n\nPer-transaction payment is self-explanatory. The subscription function needs a little explanation. Some IoT use cases need to periodically access cloud functions, and it is highly undesirable for these to fail. The gas-price mechanism still does not fully solve this problem, especially when it comes to guaranteeing transactions on every block. With this in mind, we came up with the idea of using the staking mechanism to manage a guaranteed quota with a subscription model. On the Substrate side, we did a little trick, based on zero-weight transaction priority processing. If an IoT device activates a subscription, then all its transactions will have priority over any others, except of course other zero-weight transactions. As more tokens go into the network's staking pool, more subscriptions will become available to users. \n\n<Card>\n\n*For example:*\n\nTotal tokens: 2,000,000 XRT;\nstaked: 800,000 XRT;\nparachain bandwidth: 5400 tx per block. \n\nThis gives us 5400 * 800,000 / 2,000,000 = 2,160 monthly subscriptions for IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\nI will write about how the subscriptions and the payment pool will be distributed in a separate article entitled “Automated Subscription Auction.”\n\n### Practical Use\n\nDApp ready to go: https://robonomics.app/#/staking/\n\n![XRT staking in Robonomics dapp, new bonding screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image2.jpg)\n\nAfter the first transaction, you will get a table of statistics like this:\n\n![XRT staking in Robonomics dapp, bonding list screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image4.jpg)\n\nSending tokens between accounts on the parachain will remain disabled. The ability to transfer tokens will be enabled after the parachain goes live on the Kusama network. \n\n### Observations\n\nAs of [block # 235,047](https://robonomics.subscan.io/block/235047), we have approximately one thousand accounts; the largest token holder is the treasury. Treasury funds will not participate in staking.\n\nThe remaining accounts on the network appeared as a result of using the Exodus DApp by ERC-20 token holders, or they were participants in the first crowd loan campaign in the Kusama auctions.\n\nThanks to the integration with Subscan, XRT holders on the Robonomics parachain can use this wonderful interface: https://robonomics.subscan.io/account\n\n![Robonomics Subscan.io account screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image3.jpg)\n\nOn the Exodus DApp interface, you can see the migration statistics from the Ethereum blockchain to the Robonomics parachain: https://robonomics.app/#/exodus\n\n![XRT from the Ethereum blockchain to the Robonomics parachain in Robonomics dapp](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image6.jpg)\n\n### Further Improvements to Staking Functionality\n\nThe current task for the developers is to test the basic staking mechanisms for token holders under real conditions: adding to the staking pool, accumulating rewards, and unfreezing tokens within 7 days. \n\n*An interesting task for the community:* check the correctness of the reward calculator, taking into account the two options: a 10% annual reward for participants in the Exodus migration and a 50% annual reward for members of the crowd loan campaign.\n\nAfter the 1.3 RWS update, the staking mechanism will go live on the network. The RWS update will add subscription capability for digital twins, and the challenge of bandwidth allocation will make sense. Accordingly, we will later be able to fully assess the correctness of the staking mechanism.\n\n## Update 1.2: Tech Committee and Treasury\n\nAs with update 1.1, this has already been implemented into the parachain work. The technical committee is currently made up of six technical specialists who have taken part in the development of the parachain during the last 2 years; the DAO [transferred 692,500 XRT](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6b9a9cbe7d21badf565ebce0fb50b865da8f5f784899db5fb455d1b276d14acf) to the balance of the treasury of the parachain by burning ERC-20 tokens through the Exodus DApp. The network's treasury and technical committee are the first elements of on-chain governance that the parachain developers have implemented so far. More details about each of them are given below.\n\n### Network Technical Committee\n\nThe technical committee portal is available at: https://parachain.robonomics.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmain.frontier.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/techcomm\n\n![The technical committee portal in Robonomics parachain](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image5.jpg)\n\nAs of September 15, you can see the six members of the technical committee that were added: 2 devops specialists, a software architect, the main Substrate implementation developer, a senior robotics engineer, and a senior DApp developer.\nThe technical committee will take care of updating the parachain runtime code, starting with subsequent releases on GitHub.\n\nYou can read more about the work of this committee in the Polkadot wiki: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee\n\nUntil the Robonomics parachain goes live on Kusama, the project developers will not expand on-chain governance by adding councils or referenda. After the successful launch of the parachain, we will revisit the question of new opportunities to influence network operations for new project participants.\n\n### Treasury\n\nThe parachain treasury is available here: https://parachain.robonomics.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmain.frontier.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/treasury\n\n![The treasury in Robonomics parachain](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image1.jpg)\n\nOver the past month, ~100k XRT was distributed from the treasury to the balances of participants in the first Robonomics crowd loan campaign from Summer 2021. These operations are not shown as requests, but rather done by Sudo. Now that we have a technical committee, requests will go through a vote. \n\nIt is also worth noting an interesting mechanism of the treasury: the periodic burning of balances. You can read more about the work of the treasury in the Polkadot wiki: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-treasury\n\nThe community can request that the parachain treasury allocate XRT for tasks that will be useful in the development of Robonomics in the Polkadot ecosystem or for attracting users from the IoT market.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere are many exciting updates to come, and each will open up new opportunities for the community. Updates to the project's community development program will soon be published with more information on what will be available to the community over the next 6 months.\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\" imageSize=\"big\">\n\nEnsRationis\n\nRobonomics network architect\n\nelement: @ensrationis:robonomics.network\n\n</Card>\n\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-notification.png'\" :link=\"'https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics'\">\n\n### Join our Twitter\n\nStay tuned and follow updates\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.62c183a.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.9ea8d39.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg 480w","/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.6b2ed88.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.62c183a.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-238be7fd79705754b94eb1b07ee8d544'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-238be7fd79705754b94eb1b07ee8d544)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bYI5ICe%2bQ4G4Ae4zkgj40bdr9PHXR0dEoYlQRJISRj%2bkZ7D5/x305lNK93C0IHSNaLlGoL49MkywW1lzlnSZ2XbkAEHH51LF4MkmyO3mNT6SXcHH3476qvTPXFXeVq7bVKlNc1ikMTRsTG5XuNrHgjg4PB76tfTlbNU25JJSZOAvm7CnmekZJX2Ocg%2b3HGklpG6vqqCakcWyixHz2/exRtItUKYtV/TiQHtCSRj8kZzqZZse37ajLIxxsgnl4z/KQtqQWTaCY5FGM%2bpCMfnQ8QGLqSxXN8HjH1W5Gf4Z/a/wDWrl4c%2bI94u3V1so7tJQpSTOVYpBtJO07RnPGTgaQtMxyNdDeCfTVuPRlbeq6BauSpWWMxOMBY07qD8kjOe/A%2bNe31ClpYIS4Ri5wMdVEHOJ3V88QZ5bXRrUW%2bWkhqGdEEckWTU5blQRgg49%2bw99UOmu1RRXyrkuMcIr1kY4J2pzg8e34%2bx0t5L5XV7xPU1E8ix5MKSSs4iBOcAsSfj9tFtcp55GklO53OSdDTabyWWfkndTyyFxwj6G4Vq3lLtFDHSVCbj2yGYjBO09vTxpzeGNQeqLbWVd3jjaaCo8qMwgoANobkZ75OkJNWSbda6orJlDBJHQd/S5H%2btLl0aOSHltwe/VdKt1eauqOfIAABYAbAeq62v1xo%2bk7DX3eVatqelTzJEjwWYZA4zj5%2bdKfqX9QNplsddDaaK5pcXiKwNURRmIP7bsPnGkPW1c7gq00pU9wXJGtJUMedZSeHoIxeU8Rv5faQZ3O2X//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Polkadot for the IoT market: Robonomics is ready for real world use cases on Kusama!","path":"/blog/polkadot-for-iot-with-robonomics/","date":"August 31, 2021","description":"The Robonomics team wants to impact the Kusama network development with four scenarios from the real world. These use cases describe unique opportunities for the crypto audience and all participants of the IoT market.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\nOur team already has various business cases that are ready to leverage the parachain technology. But before we can roll out these use cases we need to obtain a parachain in the [Kusama Parachain Auctions](https://kusama.network/auctions/). So, let’s talk about each of these current use cases.\n\n## Meet Spot, our Robodog\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_xBLkszEwWk\n\nThis summer, the first group of engineers learned to work with our own Spot as part of the [spot-sdk.education](https://spot-sdk.education) course. By the end of September, anyone, anywhere in the world can take our course and get his hands on with the robodog from [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot). The course is developed by robotics specialists from the [ITMO University](https://en.itmo.ru/) in St. Petersburg and [Merklebot](https://merklebot.com/) acting as the local operator in the San Francisco Bay Area lab, the home of our Spot. \n\nAccessing Spot is organized through the use of two parachains - the Robonomics and Statemine parachains. Logs of the students passing the course will be recorded on the Robonomics Parachain where the [Statemine parachain](https://polkadot.network/statemine-upgrade-launches-new-phase-of-parachain-functionality/) is being used to replace user accounts with unique access tokens that students will receive after payment of their course.\n\n## An Urban Sensor Network on the Volga river\n\nOne experiment that is leveraging the power of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/) based Blockchain technologies is currently taking place in Tolyatti. The focus here is creating an alarm network detecting high levels of air pollution without a commercial focus and being dependent on a government, but solely being supported by the citizens of Tolyatti and the Russian Airalab organization. The automatically collected information on exceeding the level of air pollution will be used for a quick response of the mobile laboratory, which is already capable of conducting a detailed analysis of particles in the air.\n\nAll data collected by the Urban Sensor Network will be securely recorded in the Robonomics parachain to avoid any possibility of intervention in the measurement history and provide security from disabling the network during attacks of the main server. \n\nIt is an example of the social impact the Robonomics project can have in these times where [90% of the world's population breathes dirty air](https://www.bloomberg.org/blog/accelerating-clean-air-action-one-data-point-at-a-time/). Thus, with the help of Kusama we can have a trustable, immutable way of storing pollution data which can be used for science to create a better world for all [protected against corrupted actors on both corporate and government level](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/06/05/corruption-is-a-threat-to-planet-earth/).\n\n<Card>\n\nWatch **a step-by-step process** of how to connect an SDS011 Air Quality Sensor to the Robonomics Decentalized Sensor Network from our Community member\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AQ7ZzgbN7jU\n\n</Card>\n\n## Digital Twins for Smart Leasing\n\nThere is an interesting new use case in Robonomics. For four months already, an industrial manipulator has been operating in a manufacturing facility in the United States with an hourly wage. At the end of each shift, the manipulator updates its digital twin instance stored in the parachain. Based on the changes in the digital twin, an invoice is issued for the use of the manipulator structured as IoT-enabled leasing. \n\nThus, we can say that Kusama will be an example of a fintech solution from web3 for the new industry 4.0. [Someday the public will understand the significance of this use case](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/manufacturing/us-supply-chain-of-the-autonomous-robots.pdf), and we will see a boom of DeFi for this modern industry!\n\n## Digital Passports for IoT systems\n\nTwo projects — one is from New Zealand — are using parachains for recording data about production manufacturing. In one case, data about the content of substances in the ground on farms is collected, in the second — data about the final assembling of medical equipment. \n\nBoth scenarios would help the Kusama network to expose itself as a registry for global production distributors.\n\n<Card>\n\n**Project 1** New Zealand’s premier industry is considered to be Agriculture. Climate change and clean water in our rivers are also at the forefront of New Zealand’s concerns. Luckily, with the advances in precision agriculture and the efficiency of our world-leading practices, our sheep and beef farmers can claim to produce less Greenhouse Gas Emissions to get a piece of meat to a dinner table in London than the comparable farmers in Wales:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGMeYKInAk\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n**Project 2** Demonstration of the work of an automated workstation for video recording of the assembly process and testing of complex technical products.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wmeBIbNaBlQ\n\n</Card>\n\n## Second Wave of Kusama Crowdloans\n\nWe would love to see your support for [Robonomics during its crowdloan](https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot/) for the 6-10th parachain slot on the Kusama network so we can implement each use case as soon as possible!\n\nWhile these use cases are just scratching the surface of the potential that the Robonomics Network will bring to the industry 4.0 after obtaining a parachain slot on [Kusama](https://kusama.network/), they demonstrate the numerous capabilities of Web3 that are not yet being explored or utilized. \n\n*This is only the beginning of Robonomics' Web3 journey, and ultimately we plan to enable millions of interoperable IoT devices in the Polkadot ecosystem, including many of which have not yet been conceived, but are already possible with [the technology of Robonomics](https://blog.aira.life/a-brief-introduction-to-robonomics-9b7884172e77)!*\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-future.png'\">\n\n### Want to be a part of the future?\n\nHead over to the [Robonomics Crowdloan page](https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot/) or the [Kusama Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/parachains/crowdloan) and support us building the infrastructure for the Smart Robotic grid of tomorrow!🦾\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-ab82f7b91d70eeb1933e82d3d64ef8a1'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-ab82f7b91d70eeb1933e82d3d64ef8a1)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bqxKvH%2bPY5H7MtyOVZVg3CsqF6pKb36u2Oicuw3JUcCa0l%2b%2bZt1qQSpR2AGogmdZE/wA9aVITcZS1CUpaRbpKR3wCq9YjwHOQ2lUiYrRLLepv9fT%2b%2bN3VUvD3UfDU8b/AMNf9v1ccNzPDFtpARTqehaVApKac8AD3/Uvr98MLvlkdkEU0/e3Ckw0wsE7lMx4CfXyrPaJCgu8KvSqghlEtJUlwZ1ZgcnRywDqAogHMP3txbAiLGadvzpCWQP5kk3/ABjXfNPDkJQDEhZgDmPl79ibaW%2bb64iKp4c85JXEhFq/UlNPfCiL7A83Q%2b2EL1Q2NGi7cTP2HDP4j3rJ240NE9hEiSVRSRzHGk6pF9dDitJbaTIcEdSlMhRyFQ1I7Xwa4qjtO1SpSqBH5NNW6oxS42oISknpB/7gLGadRHbS%2bUqdCQFlJuL99cSQ%2bcmrG2CX3ZQSRGuogGcGNQobjlTJ4SUabV%2bKVKcQyqCwzmlpd1StC1BvLr3Ocn%2bnGpcUcBUXhutcOz49Tg0ZpL6lPIfuFyG02UbK16gNMvodDgTwA2mn1J2K2AWZqUhwWsQUHMkg%2bu498OHjTSo0qj0Z%2by0kOKASpZWACm/f7YZ4ghm64kLVYjs8tlAj1BHOsgavHktl1Kz5nr6yZ8TXnr5Tzq5NUqiWXJLi3UR47HNcSgkkFewTuNLk/QYvsyk0dk1OnSmZTjgWyyxMp6FhRBF1FJ0SOwO5N7euDK%2bH4iiSb30tYWsR3GIaBF5ocuoKuPx6fbFieEguBf1D8oPdhERy7pPLWZzjIkK%2bI7tbZaUskERlXvH6obw9KkcT1p1ufGgJqa45bpsVlhMeO%2b/e4S4U6gkE22BIAJAwtSplRdddVI5YcUrqyMoFiNCLCwHtjQ6bCTTZ8ebEUEyI7gcbUUBQChsbHfHS5SGFqUVbqUVGw7nFim1YSskIEabf7pUYccvEpCUuqEdTikunzKxNaXBfqbceKLKSHUHIEg3OgBudj%2bcVqtIqkaWmMwqFIaaCQX22coULA%2b%2b%2b51w9%2bSx9P8Ynksf/AEYBVkytwqWJTGIEe9AOLPhBQlZAJkwYknJMZJ55r//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Second Robonomics Crowdloan campaign","path":"/blog/kusama-crowdloan-second-wave-details/","date":"August 20, 2021","description":"The second wave of auctions in the Kusama network will start on September 01, 2021. Robonomics will participate in the slot auction starting from the first day of the second wave. Take a look at details","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\nThis is great news indeed! There were many concerns that the successful connection of the first 5 parachains would shift the focus of the entire community and developers to replicating already tried mechanisms in the Polkadot network. But no! Not long after, and you can see how the Kusama network is deciding to hold a second wave of auctions. The Robonomics team is pleased with this news, and we will try to get into the list of projects that can say with confidence they are part of the Polkadot ecosystem in September.\n\nBelow you will find the final parameters of the second crowdloan of the Robonomics company, and the answers to the most interesting questions that we, as the project developers, have tried to proactively highlight.\n\n## From the past to the present\n\nDuring the first auctions of the Kusama network, Robonomics published a crowdloan module for the start of the 3rd auction. It was necessary to try to guess the sufficient fundraising limit. As a result, it was decided to set a collection limit of 135,000 KSM. If you look at the results of auctions from the 3rd to the 5th, then the limit was chosen, we can say with pinpoint accuracy:\n\n![An Overview of the First Five Parachain Slot Auctions on Kusama](./images/kusama-crowdloan-second-wave-details/auctions-on-kusama-overview.png)\n*Source: Making History: [An Overview of the First Five Parachain Slot Auctions on Kusama](https://polkadot.network/making-history-an-overview-of-the-first-five-parachain-slot-auctions-on-kusama/)*\n\nAlso, as can be seen from the statistics of the last Robonomics crowdloan company, about ~ 27,000 KSM were collected in total. Among the projects that participated in the first wave of auctions, such a volume allowed the project to be on the 7th line, i.e. become the second project among those who did not receive a slot in the first wave. In general, we are confident that the second wave of auctions should be successful not only for the Kusama chain, but also for us personally. In general, in order to successfully pass the second wave of auctions, we want to do the main thing - not to change the conditions of participation…\n\n## 2nd Robonomics Crowdloan parameters\n\nRobonomics Developers will publish the KSM crowdloan module on August 30 with the following parameters:\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside grid-3\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n<Card>\n\nRobonomics Parathread ID = 2077\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\nThe start of the crowdloan company - from the 6th auction of the Kusama network.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\nCrowdloan limit - 135,000 KSM\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\nFor each KSM bonded, you’ll get 3.5 XRT on the horizon of 48 weeks\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n1.725 XRT will be unlocked within the first month after the Robonomics parachain launch\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\nKSM bonders will get the entire reward in one year of XRT staking with an increased APR of up to 100%\n\n</Card>\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n<Card>\n\nAll members of the crowdloan company will receive a Robonomics Pioneer NFT card.

By mid-September, we will have to finish checking the functionality of the update 1.1 Staking and 1.2 Treasury and Technical committee updates of the [Frontier network](/blog/robonomics-frontier/), which in turn will significantly reduce the time to implement these updates after the launch in Kusama. Also, all balances of parachain users in the Frontier network will be transferred to the Robonomics parachain managed by Kusama ASAP.\n\nThus, the updated roadmap for the development of the Robonomics parachain for the period of slot leasing will look like this:\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 1: Establishing core functionality\n\nIn 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n* **Genesis state: (0 week)** Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.\n* **Update 1.1** Staking and allowing transfers (0 - 1 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for all token holders and 50% for Crowdloan participants.\n* **Update 1.2** Treasury and Technical committee (2 - 3 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n* **Update 1.3** RWS (4 - 5 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n* **Update 1.4** Robot-as-a-service (6 - 7 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n* **Update 1.5** XCMP functionality and Robobank (8 - 9 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n* **Update 1.6** Democracy and Remove Sudo (10 - 11 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D\n\n2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.\n\n* **Globally available digital passports of products**. By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.\n* **Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics**. We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries. The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n* **Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits**. It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n* **Fault-tolerant civil sensors network**. A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.\n* **Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas**. It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n* **Ecosystem integration updates**. We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain. This is our vision of the future of Robonomics, as a complete segment of the Polkadot infrastructure specifically prepared for working with IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\n## In conclusion\n\nKusama is an experimental network, and the main thing for which it is worth participating in any activity around this network is the desire to be involved in a large experiment. When deciding whether you will help Robonomics during the second crowdloan company or not, the only significant question for you should be - do I want to see the functionality of connecting IoT devices from the real world under the control of the Kusama network in the near future? If you answer is yes, then you are as crazy as we are - you want to turn the world around, which means you are welcome on board!\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-notification.png'\" :link=\"'https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics'\">\n\n### Join our Twitter\n\nStay tuned and follow updates\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.c6e7484481c1104ca1a5fc0088afa978.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.c6e7484481c1104ca1a5fc0088afa978.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.c6e7484481c1104ca1a5fc0088afa978.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.c6e7484481c1104ca1a5fc0088afa978.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-e660ce8152b6856b81da2c955229cb8c'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-e660ce8152b6856b81da2c955229cb8c)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgcEBQgBA//EADEQAAEDAgQEAwYHAAAAAAAAAAECAwQFEQAGEiETMUFRBxSRCCMyYXGhFyRCQ7HB0f/EABkBAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGAQIDBP/EACkRAAEDAwMCBQUAAAAAAAAAAAECAxEABCESMWEFQQZRcYHwEyKRwdH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AE1T6mjUNxzwx22W6fTIj70%2bI5KfJ/Ksr4imkjqtQ2Sb/p3Pe2FFl9GlmZO4aXVRgnShXK5PM/TF3Mnz0MU594IaYdXdQb57K5EXuNuhth9uLs6wlsSBv/K41dAs3Ggq6dKVLH2gJnvEkyBuD7D0pkoqSAndQxFm1NBQbq2wGVGrqpMzSG2nUrSFBLidVt%2bnbESbm5c1S0piXddOka1gpO%2b21ufS98ELcBxCXQMGl248LLtLhbDpykkcV712TCkpWHaghhdyNHCUs9O23f0wMCLBVw9dTQnUFFXuFnSRyHzvgszrkKqUfL7Nfffpz8Va0tOJiE%2b7UbjqLHcEXGA2n0mo1NtxynwZElDfxqaQVAbE/wBH0xZ%2b9a0QhWPnFGrRlDTQ0nHnRVkbK1HrC5r1WqmiIwvhtJbUGlvnne6gbC33OJvivkCJlWDS6nR5T79OnXTpfsVoVpChuAAQRfp0x3wlyXTsyRqpU6zImeUp622/Kxti6td7XPTlbDJ8TsvvZly1Eg02EuG/TEKXwZZKVFpLZ0lJI33BB%2bvosOdSK3ihCVEAwSNhiczHG0xOYqwc%2bncaFub7CP3%2bd/as9ZeqjcJ15qUlSoshOhzTzHYjBLHepMdzzKqqt9N9QbVcknmLjqQe%2bAAbYlMYyt1F1WknemG26gWEpCm0r05TqBx37ESJzBmrqqzlVOcp4JITbShPYDEHQriJSUquSBbkTvi2y0wh%2bSQsXGD%2bm5ahTqtTGXQpKXJLKCU7EArSNsGbi5Sw2GhtFDX7hTrynHTKlGSeTTbz5kBFI8L5NIm%2bWRT2Iq5MdTJVqYcbSVlJ1E6gSfixlGkVSVSJrcyCsIfQDpKk6gLgi9j132xuP2iWlfhbmGQ24UKYiEAWuCFuJSr7X9cYQ74W7dYdbIPff56VDTWgaZkc1tP2bM1T865XqkmuMQFOQ5qEtqYjhBJ0hWo9L3O1rYNvFRLYoZeIAcS08ATz08NRP8DCb9k9x2N4fZhfZXpWKk2Btf8AbT/uL/x7zbOpWRVTAlp51x3yKQoWCA62u6tuZGnl88Ahe29r1FHT0pIkYjYCDzx5VotsqSVV/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Tech AMA [Robonomics frontier network, XRT staking, Kusama crowdloan rewards]","path":"/blog/ama-2021-08-04/","date":"August 4, 2021","description":"On Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Robonomics Software Architect Sergei Lonshakov hosted a tech AMA in the Robonomics telegram community.

Before the next wave of auctions, the project’s developers decided to deploy and maintain a functionally identical network.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Not a wild cousin of Kusama\n\nKusama Relay chain is under development and passes all updates using stable versions of Polkadot releases. For example, the current version of Kusama was built on [polkadot v0.9.8](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.8) release.\n\n![Kusama Relay Chain and Polkadot release 0.9.8](./images/Robonomics-Frontier/Kusama-Relay-Chain-and-Polkadot-release-0-9-8.jpg)\n\nFrontier Relay chain will use the same versions of Polkadot releases, which will be implemented by Kusama network in the form of its Relay chain.\n\nTo connect to Frontier Relay chain, you can use Substrate portal following this link: https://parachain.robonomics.network/ \n\nAfter connecting the Robonomics parachain to the Frontier Relay chain we can have a blockchain that could work in real-time and would be integrated into the Kusama network. It means that we need to overcome any challenges that Kusama parachains will have. All new capabilities that will appear with new Polkadot releases, will be also supported by Robonomics’ parachain.\n\n## XCMP and integration with Kusama parachains\n\nMaybe only one disadvantage today (in 2021), when we are talking about the lifecycle in a Frontier network and not about the main Kusama network, is a lack of integration via [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain#overview-of-xcmp).\n\nBut it does not mean that you cannot execute technical integration tasks and prepare a Robonomics parachain to work with Karura, Moonriver and Khala. It is those three parachains that are interesting for the Robonomics team in terms of integration. We can start maintaining work in a Frontier network with copies of the mentioned projects, but only after release of public documentation and first samples of using Kusama (how to create trading pair on Karura, connect functions of parachain with solidity/ink smart contracts in Moonriver, or to provide data privacy with Khala).\n\nI’m personally expecting that the process of parachains integration would be executed very carefully in the first year, and maybe other projects will also work together in sandboxes and after it transfer integration mechanisms to Kusama network. So, Robonomics could be in the Kusama network right to the moment of active integration between the projects.\n\n## Genesis block of Robonomics parachain in Frontier network\n\nIn the genesis block will be presented XRT balances of exodus participants, crowdloan contributors and open test network collators. This block will be formed only a few days before the parachain launch in a Frontier network. We will announce this update on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) and [Telegram](https://t.me/Robonomics_ann).\n\nWe are expecting that the genesis block will be formed during the period from 28th to 31st of July.\n\nImportant information for XRT holders in the Ethereum network: To participate in the parachain’s genesis block and participate in staking, you can use dapp exodus till 28th of July. After 28th of July the opportunity to transfer XRT tokens into Ethereum to Frontier will still be available. But this process will be executed by the technical committee of the network and not more often than once a week.\n\nAlso we would like to notice, that the exodus would not allow you to go back till the moment when Robonomics parachain will be connected to the Kusama network, and when there will be suitable bridge to Ethereum. The situation is ~ similar to the process of transfer to Ethereum 2.0 for ETH holders.\n\n## XRT staking\n\nXRT staking in Robonomics parachain aims to split the capacity between two options of payments: for transaction or for subscription. You can read more about this in the article [“RWS overview, part 2 “Heterogeneous tokenomics”](https://blog.aira.life/rws-overview-part-2-heterogeneous-tokenomics-afc209cc855) on Medium.\n\nThe basis of reward for the staking will be ~ 10%. This amount helps to launch the parachain. In the future, the reward will be determined by [Democracy pallet](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/pallet_democracy/) for XRT holders. \n\nCrowdloan contributors will get increased reward rate — 50%. Thus, it will help us to test the mechanism: “Parachain, which always wins”, which will propose adaptive reward for staking Robonomics to the reward for staking in Kusama / Polkadot relay chain and considering XRT price to KSM/DOT. We will explain later in detail about this mechanism and after a few tests. \n\nStaking will be available from the update 1.1 in Frontier network. Please note that tokens transfer in parachain will be turned off on the start, similar to the launch of the Polkadot Relay chain.\n\n## Roadmap - Life after auction\n\nRegardless of that we did not win a slot — the roadmap of parachain development won’t change. Below you will find our plans that were published in the article: https://robonomics.network/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/.\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 1: Establishing core functionality\n\nIn 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n* **Genesis state: (0 week)** Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.\n* **Update 1.1** Staking and allowing transfers (3 - 4 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for all token holders and 50% for Crowdloan participants.\n* **Update 1.2** Treasury and Technical committee (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n* **Update 1.3** RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n* **Update 1.4** Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n* **Update 1.5** XCMP functionality and Robobank (11 - 12 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n* **Update 1.6** Democracy and Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D\n\n2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.\n\n* **Globally available digital passports of products** By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.\n* **Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics** We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries. The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n* **Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits** It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n* **Fault-tolerant civil sensors network** A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.\n* **Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas** It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n* **Ecosystem integration updates** We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain. This is our vision of the future of Robonomics, as a complete segment of the Polkadot infrastructure specifically prepared for working with IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\" imageSize=\"big\" alignContentV=\"middle\">\n\n#### EnsRationis\n\nRobonomics network architect\n\nelement: @ensrationis:robonomics.network\n\n</Card>\n\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.62c183a.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.9ea8d39.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 480w","/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.6b2ed88.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.62c183a.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-c500a3a46c2e1383ad9128ddf93beeb6'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-c500a3a46c2e1383ad9128ddf93beeb6)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bPZ%2bNUV66/8ARGnQ5D9QXKKXmFMAPb2gENG5sCSeokXNgLWGTrn1a/aqhNcaoVPlNylvlDTTKy826L2G1JG8E4sLnQNQ7pVRJbiKQuGacxJ5smWW1tN3QWj3JIwf7x8jWpJi0cSkIQiMGgltKnNi7J6hcnySPJHfxqjw%2bpEeUxDLU1qaXVB8F1LXSMbQVDpOCDfW81%2bzyIRUy/M2OJSHEGQjIGbHo8Ht60SONhgzaASOffKpzNcJMi4gKFa4fp8ymS36aYrJYW4/zG0qSlxOMAKNwMYHi%2bfhAGnxEp%2bXDFPpTdRmR5CnU8oOpdKlAZVZOex7kZ0kOMOMuraeQpt1BKVIULFJGCCPB1XtkjsWCjXCmlEjchI699l0KhmNG2lUdt7Yb8tZO0/e3fVPiQpkblEJDilFRCQAB9h40K%2bgSMpOtrAtdmCn6Z7XQGLEcV%2bk78H/AFA4cpsVqFUqAqnKSWiqbTFkqWUKuCtCyb3uQcm4JGsPjVXDNLdVVOAuJ3%2ba8/zBA/TLQWAb5DhAGOw85xpImjr0Knspk1COyv8AgtYB%2b2l2bxgbMHRSOAJ/G7B/oEjc9EJWlcIsj6TDwvwfP4meS/JdcbaduUOL61um%2bbXP3yfWn9z6asQYTyBDn7XAlKlKcsL/ANDPr1rCbqzke3JbQhA7ITcJA9D41VqXFkshIDaRtP8AkXY%2bvPjTlpPCtZVAE939pRll1Wqk2diOgPpWoUWfwJX2qjQkmPLeCmmWJqAtDqTa4CsZB22v%2bdIdUlSahVJcueSZb7qnHbi3UTnVyoVB2c4FuixH%2byj/ANJ0OpnnNRZBSkOLQUKIH8inG4/NrfjXcvhdPp3jURtpx2K1YsmEBxsntf/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Crowdloan unveils plan B to win with plan A","path":"/blog/kusama-crowdloan-guaranteed-rewards/","date":"July 2, 2021","description":"Risk-free contribution in Robonomics Crowdloan announcement.

For four years, in parallel with the Parity developers, we studied the future network architecture, tried early developments of the Substrate framework and prepared the Robonomics parachain for launch with one goal - to create a vertical in the Polkadot ecosystem that will be machine-friendly.\n\nRobonomics team consists of robotics engineers, academic researchers, and software developers. We are one of the few who have been studying the possibilities of Bitcoin, Ethereum, IPFS and Polkadot for communication between people and automated services connected to the Internet for seven years. We want to see smart cities of the future today, but we don't wish these cities of the future to be smart concentration camps for people watching you and can get access to your house, car, or pacemaker without your permission. \n\nI am sure that the only alternative for total control is the p2p economically significant interaction, so the IoT platform we are developing is called Robonomics.\n\nBy winning a parachain slot in the Kusama network, we will open the doors for hundreds of IoT developers to the Polkadot ecosystem and help them take their first steps under the guidance of experienced teachers and roboticists. Most IoT developers we interviewed are happy to try an alternative to the usual corporate clouds, but it simply does not exist today. Almost every engineer we know understands the problems associated with client-server solutions. However, today there is still no environment that a corporation does not manage and at the same time produces user’s trust.\n\nPolkadot is a trust-free ecosystem, and Robonomics is a way to connect smart devices under its control. Contribute to its development. We offer up to 5 XRT per 1 KSM to early supporters who bonds the first 35,000 KSM. The proposed reward makes Robonomics Crowdloan more profitable than stacking in Kusama Relay Chain at the current rate by more than two times.\n\nWe’ll announce the launch of the Robonomics Crowdloan campaign on [the Robonomics Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) account in the coming hours.\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Read the terms of participating in the Robonomics crowdloan campaign in the blog:\n\n[https://robonomics.network/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/](/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Participate in the crowdloan through the dedicated page:\n\n[https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot](/kusama-slot)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### You can also always use the standard interfaces from parity:\n\n[https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\" imageSize=\"big\">\n\n### Welcome to our journey!\n\nEnsRationis\n\nRobonomics network architect\n\nelement: @ensrationis:robonomics.network\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.62c183a.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.9ea8d39.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg 480w","/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.6b2ed88.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.62c183a.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-4ad3c9a39399fbd946f97d535a8cc506'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-4ad3c9a39399fbd946f97d535a8cc506)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQYHBAII/8QALxAAAQMCBQIGAQMFAAAAAAAAAQIDBAURAAYSITETQQcUIlFhcYEVMpEWQlKSof/EABoBAAEFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAQIDBQf/xAAqEQABAwMDAwMEAwAAAAAAAAABAgMRBCFBAAUxElFhBnGxExQjkTKB8f/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AOxvCx6C4VuVSC4FDQEvMKI%2bxvzjTIyJ0JLEd2RSEuyLpbHlVdhzztiiQPMVwymnabLp6Y7pSlT9iXU8ahbYDfbn59sAMxUiR/VbKy68rrBIYATcWHIB7Ecm/vf4xp0RVUVDiHLJAse5z%2btNuvrDeKanS8hfUsm46U8WjGfnS254drXJDfnaQl0i/STHI2tbi/wCccxPBd3fzlQfPt0IxN/5O33hnzNVqLl6pxpk5TjtTWAlphs7quQkq9hz3P0MO1cTBFQUqTNk9QWPl9akoF9B5CT/gP9le%2bK3nC3Ya0ab1DvS2g4twpSrg9KbxzFsakbvg48y%2bhyNPUppBuRJikX/g4xSsrNQnZDLrkFwMhIffRTnFtsbA%2bpQNgbWJ5sDc2xYoDcCBBmz25c10txHFLZcdUtKUjc2uBc7WvieRJ6KzImyaHJS1S5LIRIcdBUtlTmpTitF7JskJF1bDbnCac6xJxoxrfNzVK3XSUDMJAmRnpN44EfEaWp%2bVINOQ%2b07VKKt9KVDpJaUpwEgmwGrY77X%2bMI9MynLeml%2bp1dmNCKkIjpjR3HEOa9gpa1BPHsLj2vg7V89UJFSdms0N6TSCsN9VUlxKnUgBOoIChYEJHIN/zit5agZfqMGBU8v0yC7AkoDjT4ZGofG9yCCCPsYtMiDqxz1K6w2lSnVqVmPpgSMGOo/0dbs01%2boQ8lUOXGWqPIkuIS6tCdaUpP7r9wPnCtU8zVCnlM9t52cpTejpBKVA2BIseb7kH8YVv1SeqbU4rsyQ5Hj%2biO2twlDOpei6UnbhRwYjp0VNxCFKShKQ2oXvrsAQo/Pqtf7/AA7FK%2bwn8vSoZgEHzfjEgQO065%2b7UoWQbza2DEYtzruPCkViJTG6zpVKW%2b06%2bpXKvVcgW2G222KJVc3UOMuot1BaFTorCXn2UOFJCCbJJuQE8jvtcHuMJDbi0OocQQFN2UNu98Zqu6KtKMaWyxpmMqakOIbCXHEAgpTrG9gd7YD3agrXK1p1lQDSQAoE837R28i/jR1DuKVoU0sRJKgBwJ5%2bPNtUNUqDLokg0xrS3MiqBUtZUSlafs%2b%2bJVAjuQMsPxWWI0aSGnGHlFdkuJsQpRIFydJv34wbpc%2bVDakwmlo8vHKGWwUeoI6Y9N%2b/H/cEIOW4dWgOT3nJCHo6rpShdklO10kW735wPtzdTtqKio3FcpP8YwADNreO/vqdXVF9SaamHBBUCYBj/TjXnNvKlXjUdMGZqSuQrWwlKCUO3ub9T9vAvcm%2b/GLXkGtVbLmTKdR2qdEeWxFC21peJAJUVHV73Ctvfm5wqeJstapUOCEoRFbb6iEJFgP7QPoAYdsoZdad8P28wuyn1Tlp0gE%2bgJSvRa3fYD6tgvbar7inTU1CbkWA97CbYGdLcyVJCKZATF1GT2uYM/oa/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Crowdloan final parameters and 48 weeks roadmap","path":"/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/","date":"June 28, 2021","description":"Robonomics Developers publish the KSM crowdloan module on June 28th.

It’ll allow competing for the 3rd slot.** At the moment, PLO auction participants bid around 25,000 - 30,000 KSM for the 5th slot\n* **For each KSM bonded, you’ll get 3.5 XRT on the horizon of 48 weeks.** Based on the current XRT and KSM price, Robonomics crowdloan offer outperforms Kusama Relay Chain staking by x1.5\n* **1.725 XRT will be unlocked within the first month** after the Robonomics parachain launch\n* **KSM bonders will get the entire reward in one year of XRT staking** with an increased APR of up to 100%\n* **Distribution of the crowdloan rewards will happen in Robonomics parachain. There won’t be an option to get rewards in ERC-20 XRT**\n\n## Bonuses\n\n* **Robonomics crowdloan won’t provide any referral bonuses**\n* **Increased reward for the first 35,000 KSM collected.** Get 5 XRT instead of 3,5 in one year\n* **Extra reward for [Robonomics Polkapet NFT](https://opensea.io/assets/0x8cb813bf27dc744fc5fb6ba7515504de45d39e08/24) holders, who’ll bond the first 35,000 KSM.** Get 6 XRT instead of 3,5 XRT in one year.\n\n## Most important to know\n\nRobonomics developers are early adopters of Polkadot. We understand that the current technical implementation of the Kusama Relay Chain and Substrate framework may contain errors and be reviewed this or next year. The participants of the crowdloan campaign need to keep that in mind.\n\nBesides, the entire Polkadot ecosystem is establishing now, this process may take an indefinite time. Don’t forget this whenever studying any plans of developers.\n\nThis is a grand experiment, ladies and gentlemen.\nYou want to participate in it at your own risk.\n\nWelcome to our journey!\n\n## Roadmap - Life after auction\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Part 1: Establishing core functionality\n\nIn 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n* Genesis state: (0 week). Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.\n* Update 1.1: Staking and allowing transfers (3 - 4 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for token holders and 100% for Crowdloan participants.\n* Update 1.2: Treasury and Technical committee (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n* Update 1.3: RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n* Update 1.4: Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n* Update 1.5: XCMP functionality and Robobank (11 - 12 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n* Update 1.6: Democracy and Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D\n\n2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.\n\n* Globally available digital passports of products. By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.\n* Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics. We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries.  The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n* Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits. It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n* Fault-tolerant civil sensors network. A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.\n* Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas. It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n* Ecosystem integration updates. We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain.

Becoming one of Kusama's parachains is a good way to provide access to your Substrate project within the Polkadot ecosystem, implement currently unavailable Blockchain network security to small projects, as well as initiate the integration process with other ecosystem projects as soon as possible. The goal of Robonomics for 2022 is to become a fully functioning conductor of IoT projects to the Polkadot ecosystem. This is why all of the aforementioned benefits of launching a Kusama network are important to us. And in general, our strategy has [already been published](/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/) a long time ago - \"Kusama first, while Polkadot is a vision\". In this post, we’ll dissect the use of the Cowdloan module in detail and take a look at the parachain update plan after launching. \n\n## Kusama crowdloans have started!\n\n*Dr. Gavin Wood, June 8, 2021, [Kusama Parachain Auctions](https://polkadot.network/kusama-parachain-auctions/):*\n\n> The following is the case assuming that no significant and unexpected issues are found with the relay-chain logic. (In such a case, all options should remain on the table for network governance, including pausing or postponing any scheduled or ongoing auctions.)\n\n**Preliminary schedule of auctions:**\n\n- 2021/06/15, 12:00 GMT: First Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences. Bids may be placed.\n\n- 2021/06/22, 12:00 GMT: Second Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/06/29, 12:00 GMT: Third Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/07/06, 12:00 GMT: Fourth Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/07/13, 12:00 GMT: Fifth Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\nPolkadot allows parachains to source tokens for their parachain bids in a decentralized [crowdloan](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crowdloans). Once a crowdloan campaign is open, anyone can participate by sending a special transaction that references the campaign's index. Tokens used to participate must be transferable — that is, not locked for any reason, including staking, vesting, and governance — because they will be moved into a module-controlled account that was generated uniquely for this campaign.\n\nFour projects who launched their KSM crowdloan campaigns (Kurara up to 1,5 mln KSM, Shiden up to 1 mln KSM, Crust up to 1 mln KSM, Moonriver up to 1 mln KSM)  to collect resources for leasing the parachain slot on Kusama during the parachain lease offering auctions. \n\nRobonomics Dev DAO aims to bid an exact amount of KSM needed for securing a third-fifth parachain slot. Thus, the crowdloan module will be launched right after the end of the auction for 2nd slot on Kusama.\n\n## Estimated time of the Robonomics crowdloan launch is 28 June\n\nYou’ll be able to participate in the Robonomics crowdloan through the [dedicated page](/kusama-slot).\n\n**Before participating in the crowdloan, double-check that the campaign is live [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).**\n\n## How to participate in the Robonomics Crowdloan \n\nBy default, Polkadot developers provided a native interface in the [Substrate portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan)\n\n![Crowdloan on Polkadot portal](./images/kusama-crowdloan-details/crowdloan-on-polkadot-portal.png)\n*Example of the Crowdloan page on June 11th, 2021*\n\nAt the start of April, Robonomics practised participating in auctions by using the Crowdloan module on the Rococo network. You can check out this Twitter thread to familiarize yourself with the standard interface for community participation in [Polkadot auctions](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1377653645827833860)\n\nAlso, it’s worth mentioning that on the official [Robonomics site](/kusama-slot), functionality for interacting with the Crowdloan module will be made available.\n\n<!-- ![How to participate in Robonomics Crowdloan on Kusama](./images/kusama-crowdloan-details/crowdloan2.gif) -->\nThis is what Crowdloan participation will look like on the Robonomics site after June 28th. \n\nInstructions on how to use the Crowdloan interface module through the Robonomics website will be published closer to the start of the third auction. \n\n## Popular questions amongst the community\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Why does Robonomics participation start only from the third round?\n\nDevelopers could publish the Crowdloan module today, but then we would have to implement limits. As can be noticed, the first 4 projects that published their Crowdloan modules established a 1 million KSM token limit. \n\nWe’re placing our bets on 100,000 KSM being enough to win one of the Kusama network auctions, but are also reserving space for ourselves to quickly adjust the limit if we come to understand that more KSM tokens will need to be collected by the conclusion of the first and second rounds. In general, we’re trying to manoeuvre in search of an optimal rental cost for a slot.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### What will happen if Robonomics doesn’t win the 5th auction? \n\nTo be honest, we don’t have a plan B. [We'll be like Schwarzenegger](https://youtu.be/Ri-M_Vo3w5A).\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Will it be possible to participate in the Robonomics crowdloan through exchanges? \n\nSome well-known exchanges like Kraken and Okex are already providing crowdloan support for their users. A list of relevant exchanges that support interaction with the Crowdloan module will be provided on the Robonomics website at the start of the 3rd auction.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### What will happen in 48?\n\nIf after 48 weeks the project will once again be unsuccessful in winning an auction, then the parachain will turn into a [parathread](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parathreads#docsNav). However, developers have already published preparation plans for future slot auctions: here’s a publication from October 26th, 2020, [Robonomics Parachain Lease Offering, On-chain Governance Strategy](/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/). But, we also have a secret plan concerning the development of an algorithm to be built into the Robonomics protocol, which will autonomously generate beneficial bonding terms for KSM/DOT holders that will also benefit Robonomics. In general, we contemplate over medium-term issues in advance and continue to think about important matters such as maintaining Robobomics in the state of a parachain today.\n\n</Card>\n\n## Life after auctions\n\nA parachain comes to life inseparably from the moment auction results are concluded. But for a project, this doesn’t indicate that work is over. Remember how the Polkadot Relay Chain launched? The Robonomics team is contemplating over an analogous launch form, increasing functionality accessible to a user in steps. \n\n## Robonomics will start its existence with the following possibilities: \n\n- XRT transfers between balances\n\n- Launch of IoT devices using XRT for paying transaction fees \n\n- Sending IoT device telemetry using XRT for paying transaction fees \n\n- Sudo\n\n- A technical committee\n\n## Further update plan\n\n- Genesis state: Core functionality (0 week). Launch of the above set of functions.\n\n- Update 0.1: Staking (1 - 3 week). Will allow you to stake your XRT with a 10% APY for token holders and 125% for Crowdloan participants. \n\n- Update 0.2: Treasury (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. \n\n- Update 0.3: RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments but a monthly subscription as well. \n\n- Update 0.4: Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices. \n\n- Update 0.5: Robobank (11 - 12 week). You can read about Robonomics in this article:\nhttps://robonomics.network/blog/robobank-introduction/ \n\n- Update 0.6: Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee. \n\n- Ecosystem integration updates (before the end of the year). Further, we will focus attention on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in what Polkadot can do. \n\nStay tuned and follow our updates [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics)\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.62c183a.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.9ea8d39.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.6b2ed88.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.62c183a.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-7d699c7cb809c42c03af7eb60dcec7e6'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-7d699c7cb809c42c03af7eb60dcec7e6)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUGAwcA/8QAKxAAAgECBQIFBQEBAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABRIhMQYTFEFRYXEVIjKBwZGh/8QAGQEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgUDBAYH/8QAKhEAAQMCBAQGAwAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEEiExQQUTUWEGcYGRoeEUI/D/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AIynpqWSGEyVDRkyhZXsCqIRsQPyJvztbAcoRZXWJ%2b5GGIV7W1DyOPTTxQVFPD4VqmSZiFRGIOw9gTbe%2b2%2b3I3OMKha6CvlEtLNHTPGzwmcaTIwPEfJKgHzJ%2bcbRHFUN3v46lE4tAY3z01PTWI2yk1jwwqtlXMxhygDI%2bsz8R3k1sqszAKCSTYAYeUuQTd6LvfcSReJBqYn0wJl2S1tfTiejhqZo76S8VHM4UgXIuB5X3/3DmSlzwUqxDLa6VwpJfw0ysdvX%2bj1wzcvmgYxUhum3yBycuv1SGeiEZkGohhbQmk3be3OA2VlYqwIYbEEcYffSM4qYVaqy2thkdS13o52N%2bbXtY%2bYv84U5ll9bltKZq2nmgJv2llp5E7pB4BItwQcGi9ZWqEqk/wBpUrSHEp/ZQoUlgAGJJtYYJraCpoSgq4miZr2ViL/seXONMtoM6rqSvqMmimkpIY7VLpYAKPusb/F9vTCWaWpB1StJdt7tycGlxRdKZED3%2bvmp8IwyJmu3UPSL5XQQpn0EUUMUbSa42GubWL6gy7jTY/qwttiY6Z7ueZjPldHTCvlnR0pzO2plTVe7FthZbWta3zii6W6rPVWVVWW55RJKtOkatJFIYzIN7A24/Ecc4oumsqyrLsxirsoofB1MdwG7pfYj0OOe3qF8MuH%2bIXkEpAIAGQAG2epJ6j2q8h5xbAtG3FYVa6b%2bkZeVcs%2buZ/0fUVGTQzpA1LPKHRokezMArEEjggDBVF1nnlRU9iaaAPI4LBqaMXbyO42PGF3W9fLmfVOaV04UPNUMCoGw0MFH6IXj3wJkJo4qsT5hSvV08RQGBZjFr%2b7a7AE2BN9t/cYfKvLNxAdLCVKIkkgan0rS2ng68vGOcp3Ak6RmT8gCfOnld13nyt2YqqJhEunamjsg1Xtx6n/uE2a9S5tnMcCVtQjLTszxBIUQKWADHYewxpVR09XJ4rsiDvOD2YbLGguW0qLbAH5973wHFBF4mRG1lFKxjcauGNybW8vTE1q7YqVhLCUk9hvl03obzwtd8Pb54dxpTrsR39%2b9AzV1YkLxLOyo/wCeg21fNtjhb2nkcM12F7Ek4oKqlgDsqiSwAO7D39sC1tNFTdsRa7NcnUQf4MPmG2mhDaQPIVk7hwrM4pr/2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Kusama Parachain Lease Offering, April 2021","path":"/blog/kusama-parachain-auction/","date":"April 17, 2021","description":"Robonomics rewards the Kusama Parachain auction participants!","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n<div class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## 1 KSM = 1 XRT\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"text_abstract layout layout__text animate post_abstract in-viewport animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\nEvery participant will be rewarded with XRT\n\n</div>\n\n> The most relevant information is available here: https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot\n\n- Get rewards: per 1 KSM contributed, 1 XRT is rewarded\n- XRT for now is available on Uniswap, Huobi, and in addition on PancakeSwap\n- Receive increased staking of 125% return for the next 48 weeks\n- Quick rewards option: 25% right after the win, 75% after the successful launch of the Robonomics parachain (est. 2-4 weeks)\n- Contribute to the future: Robonomics integrates new technologies into the real economy \n\nCrowdloan limit: 100,000 KSM\n\nRobonomics will participate in 3rd-5th slot auctions to win.

For example, it allows Polkadot users to [pay vending machines or robots in any token of the Polkadot ecosystem](https://robonomics.network/blog/robobank-introduction/).\n\nRobonomics is a project with a long history that started in 2015, after the launch of the Ethereum network. During the project’s development, the team published more than [10 academic articles](https://robonomics.network/community#science) and created more than [15 R&D projects](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/r-and-d-based-on-robonomics-network/) which included control of drones, industrial manipulators, sensor networks, and even a Boston Dynamics’ robot dog over Ethereum and Polkadot networks.\n\nRobonomics is a project that integrates new technologies into the real economy. However, to fuel this, a reasonable ‘gas’ price is required. Kusama makes the costs of communication between IoT devices and humans affordable.\n\nKusama Auction mechanics: [https://kusama.network/auctions](https://kusama.network/auctions)\n\nParachain Crowdloans: [https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/mirror-learn-crowdloans](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/mirror-learn-crowdloans)\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n![\"Robomomics Parachain on Kusama wallpaper\"](./images/Kusama-Parachain-auction/wallpaper_KUSAMA_6.jpg)\n\n</section>\n\n**Community, support our auction** 🦾\n\nRobonomics Developers DAO\n\nStay tuned: [https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics)\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.62c183a.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":676},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.9ea8d39.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 480w","/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.6b2ed88.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.62c183a.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 676' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-453990b58408de3788085e78a03e644a'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-453990b58408de3788085e78a03e644a)' width='1500' height='676' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bM%2b%2bpFv2wUG7dl3C03fzBTVCeqEZdWVupSuRyQQOD37arnwq8O7RsGovV4a519%2buholjYzU/QEgbDBAuTknAyc8Y9udCWAOUnzMIZQhLa7S2LheqekMYUGYuvWPLII6fY506hq0qqFamnJKsMjI5HPPGohZZDuhpXjNPAlMFhM1I3XGTj0DIHK/17Eal1NTpbqBYYeVQd29yTydTqHPDGVFrAcL26fXe999I1%2bFwlK%2breOiwDKDnLduNCrEzMp9IAI40nCF4%2bo/Vk9I%2beNIOTKycYAB1SiImYCVVxyQedML9WtarRXV6KJGiTrCMcA410sDIOORoJ4Y6iJop0WSNhhlYZB0SEBgWFxMYEg2lUyeKNerKBZ4ehv5ea2MfPA0yqPFSpSBohaKBo8Y8vqkwf6x041abbfs7eq2UR%2b8K/jWs7YsTeqz28/enX8aqczgT8PXvEKlYatKL274nybdoZqe32emWOadpiHnlYl27kfR2OMgaxW/qCu9MZM7YpniT/J%2b5cKR88rq8TtPbx72O2H70yfjQnZ22z3sFqP%2bon40a4vw8a0ep/YeV9zNWwr6%2b6toWi%2bSwrTvVxeaYkYsF5Ixn37a74YGVlxyADnQUVJT0NLHTUcEUFPGMJFEoVVHwAO2t2BknHJ99SajKzkqLDaME//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robobank.

Each parachain that adds a Robobank branch to its runtime will be able to use the functions of launching a smart device running under the Robonomics parachain control.\n\n\nUsers will not have to pay commissions outside of the native parachain token  — any payment made through Robobank will provide a free execution of an automated service / launch of an IoT device for the user. The only thing that the owner of the automated service will need is an active subscription of the IoT device to use the Robonomics parachain.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## Polkadot for IoT.

This approach saves us from the fear of being in a cool but empty sandbox.\n\nThe presence of the Robonomics parachain will allow other Polkadot parachains to expand the functionality of native tokens by adding instead of the full and rather complex functionality of working with IoT devices to your virtual machine (i.e runtime), functions such as: pay for launching an IoT device or receive data from the device during the payment process.\n\nNext, we will look at an example of architecture using multiple Polkadot parachains in order to extend the capabilities of any project through infrastructure integration solutions based on XCMP.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## Robobank Architecture\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n![\"Robobank from Robonomics introduction, infographics\"](./images/robobank-introduction/robobank-introduction-infographics.png)\n\n</section>\n\nConsider an example of a truly decentralized Uber service.\n\nBy implementing Uber Parachain, developers could focus on the rating system of drivers, the system for processing user requests in p2p mode, and other customer service issues, and not worry about the need to simultaneously support the IoT component of their applications — Robonomics will help with IoT. Uber Parachain will only need to integrate the Robobank pallet into its runtime in order to provide customer access to the car after payment and receive trip reports directly from the IoT modules of the car.\n\n### Let's have a look at the diagram above and highlight the important points:\n\n* **Polkadot token** is a native parachain token, implemented for example through the assets pallet.\n* **Robonomics Web Services** is a pallet inside the Robonomics parachain, which implements the ability to connect an IoT device under the control of the Polkadot network on a monthly subscription model with guaranteed bandwidth.\n* **IoT app** is a custom application for automating the ordering of services, in which the native parachain token is used for payment. In the example with Uber Parachain, it would be a familiar phone application for city residents to order a taxi or search for a carsharing service.\n* **The car icon** is an IoT device acting as a party to an automated service, partially or completely providing a service. In the example, it would be a car, and by no means a driver! It is the car that would be the party providing access to opening the car doors and generating a trip report with telemetry data.\n* **Robobank Branch** is the Robonomics module for inclusion in the Polkadot parachain network.\n* **Robobank Tower** is the Robonomics module that runs permanently in the runtime of the Robonomics parachain and can launch IoT devices with an active subscription based on token transfer transactions in neighboring parachains.\n\nAs you can see from the diagram and the description of the modules, the parachains need to install Robobank Branch, which can be performed in the parachain [update mode](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-protocol-info#runtime-upgrades) without a hard fork.\n\nNow let's look at a step-by-step use case to represent the full cycle of the Robobank module after the Robobank Branch is enabled by the Polkadot parachain.\n\n1. `PaymentToRobot()` — this function can be seen among others in the parachain after the Robobank Branch module is enabled. As a result of a user sending a transaction from an IoT application, Robobank Branch will receive data on the amount of the payment and the device that needs to be launched for execution.\n2. `TransferToRobobank()` – will ensure the transfer of funds from the user account to the Robobank account with the ability to withdraw the accumulated amount in one transaction from the IoT device. For example, after making 10 trips or working within 5 hours, the car can generate automatic transactions to transfer funds from the Robobank account to the address of the crypto exchange. There is no actual movement of tokens from one parachain to another.\n3. `SignalToRobonomics()` — will be a function using XCMP. It is important to note that we will be able to ensure that messages sent on behalf of Robobank Branch are identified and marked as trusted. Some analogue of communication between smart contracts in the Ethereum network.\n4. `SignalFromRobonomicsBranch()`  — the message sent in the previous step will be sent through the Relay chain for processing to the central node of the Robobank Tower module. Having received a message from the parachain, Robobank Tower will record the request to launch the payment device in the Robonomics parachain, and thereby remove the need to store the payment log on the side of each parachain who uses the Robobank Branch module. In fact, the Robobank branches will perform the functions of correspondent accounts and are subordinate to the main branch in the form of a Tower, in which the full history of the execution of the automated service with payment in the neighboring parachain will be kept.\n5. `FreeTXtoRWS()` — two modules of the Robonomics parachain can trust each other, just like smart contracts in Ethereum. If we can ensure trust in the request from Robobank Branch to Robobank Tower, then in the same way we can provide the ability to launch a device with an active subscription not from the device address, but based on payment in tokens.\n6. `Launch || Datalog` — a combination of these functions will allow, for example, to launch a service for execution with an indication of the user who will have access to the back door of the car in the Uber Parachain application, or record the data necessary for the provision of the service.\n7. Steps 7-10 implement the possibility described in step 2. `TransferToRobobank()` to periodically empty your IoT device account by sending a transaction in the Robonomics parachain directly to Robobank Tower.\n\nAs a result, we examined the architecture of a solution using cross-chain transactions to expand the capabilities of a separate project at the expense of a common ecosystem.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## Current status and plans\n\n</section>\n\nAfter the first tests on the Rococo network, the developers will publish instructions for the implementation and use of the Rocobank module on the [wiki.robonomics.network](https://wiki.robonomics.network/)\n\nOur main goal is to prepare the Robobank module for the launch of parachains on the Kusama network in the summer of 2021.\n\nTo find out more, stay in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.62c183a.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.9ea8d39.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.6b2ed88.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.62c183a.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-fc595808566fddd7d9fd9cc6481a0493'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-fc595808566fddd7d9fd9cc6481a0493)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bjo9arn9TkmZA4YYi5x7%2b9PafDhheLnig31D4bc8LzMdpNcR3dtPH7tvcRqVDqDogj6IPz/wBFC9Wf6grl%2ba8ijeWXDWcNuGgtrdb5WAAY%2bRLEDZJ0fror181WJBDEfYOqbB37De586aqJsmc29uE1PSp9VYRLX2d6HxWcME07FYIZJCPkIhbX4r0H6U8Wx13w7juQeKEXk7uPd/TRMylZioO2Qkn4%2b/qqYyWSvsDzfLXGJu5rS5hvZ1WSBjGepGH%2buvx8UlKKFxJbWeJgs8MkZJIHuKV3%2ba7HFcYuWyq2kpOjFIyKgVTIyqWC%2bZBC70f3EEDVSbPKX2e5PY3eZu5765aQHznkL68ewO99dDr%2bK2c4xaY%2beGVZppJJthi5HwB0OqwNcRXhbfEfq5GatYrXJXVtayCa3R9K5VexodbHR0djY6OtjqoKqd6AO/6qxfS3B2WXxV415Ery/rYYFZu9K476qJh8JbScj5MvioSwiufbUoGAIk8AQD0Oqrsna%2bQxjcJHxlrBJwUC04HW/o/dHWKxdpZ814i6RB47p45ZYnAKEg9gD%2bD11Uz1UtMal3eTWdgttO0kNwzI/wC3/KnkVC60AKfIdULXBwqF/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"XRT token distribution Q2 2021 - Q1 2022","path":"/blog/xrt-distribution/","date":"March 18, 2021","description":"Article provides a deep dive into the XRT distribution plan","content":"\n<!-- [![How to find distribution plan, guide for website, gif](./images/XRT-distribution/XRTdisthowto.gif)](https://robonomics.network/community#token) -->\n\n*Updated XRT distribution plan available at [https://robonomics.network/community#token](https://robonomics.network/community#token)*\n\n## Introduction\n\n[The previous Distribution Plan](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZjzJbZDhs7B3YhtRkvdg4jp6qpfkVGB67w7vH2nJBUrE/Robonomics_token_Polkadot_KUSAMA_stage_details_september_2020.pdf) was released by Robonomics developers DAO back in September 2020.

Decentralized infrastructure services over IPFS, Ethereum, and Polkadot for Robotics and IoT. For industrial, consumer, and commercial solutions","content":"\n**Robonomics Web Services (RWS)** is decentralized infrastructure services over IPFS, Ethereum, and Polkadot for Robotics and IoT. For industrial, consumer, and commercial solutions.\n\n## Meet the first RWS IoT Core services\nRWS is a state-of-the-art infrastructure that you will love. RWS lets connect devices easily and interact with user applications, cloud services, and other devices securely. No single point of failure, open-source, most interesting internet tech on a turn-key basis, and your freedom to use it in any place in the world. Truly global network for Robotics and IoT devices.\n\nThe first RWS IoT Core services over Robonomics Parachain:\n\n* **RWS: PubSub Message Broker.** Use unlimited messaging over a p2p network based on IPFS protocol.\n* **RWS: Data Blockchainization Service.** Put data into IPFS and store hashes in a public Blockchain.\n* **RWS: Robot Actions.** Switch on / off; launch or stop your IoT devices under control of decentralized computer.\n\n## Let’s begin subscription model experiment with RWS token\nThe main token of Robonomics network is XRT. This is utility token which your robotics / IoT devices can use to pay transactions fee to interact over Ethereum today. Soon, XRT will give your robotics systems the same opportunity in the Polkadot ecosystem with Robonomics Parachain.\n\nFor engineers, Core Dev team will try to make different Robonomics usage models and the first step in this way is launching lifetime subscription token — RWS token. As Tesla promoted their roadster with lifetime charging, so we want to promote Robonomics network with lifetime subscription offer for the first. Become a robot economy pioneers!\n\n> ### 1 RWS token will give you 1 transaction per second (tps) from/to your IoT device over Robonomics Parachain.\n>\n> Just activate your RWS token and make more than 2,500,000 tx in a month with no time limits. Deactivate RWS token and trade it on Uniswap any time you want.\n\n**Example case 1:** You own 0.1 RWS token and want to share telemetry with shadow in Public blockchain every 10 seconds. You need to activate it with transaction to special address of ethereum mainnet smart contract. After that, you can use RWS: Data Blockchainization Service each 10 seconds (1 RWS token == 1 tps, 0.1 RWS token == 1 tx / 10 sec).\n\n**Example case 2:** You own 2 RWS token and want to control automatic car wash under Robonomics control. You need to activate it with transaction to special address of ethereum mainnet smart contract. After that, you can use RWS: Data Blockchainization Service and RWS: Robot Actions each second in parallel mode.\n\n**Current status of RWS token:** initial distribution stage.\n\n**Total supply:** 100 RWS tokens which will present lifetime using of 100 tps Robonomics Parachain bandwidth.\n\n**Distribution plans:**\n* 50 RWS tokens will be distributed via [Uniswap XRT/RWS pair](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x42018a2ff89b6d662b5f746277bd02f0d85f485a).\n* 50 RWS tokens will be reserved for academia and non-profit organizations.\n\n**Expected time to launch RWS token functions:**\n* alpha version — Q3 2020\n* beta version — Q4 2020\n\n**Further emission of RWS.** Benchmarks of Polkadot Parachains indicate that 100 tps is a small part of potential bandwidth of Robonomics Parachain. At the same time, Core Dev team want to make different types of subscriptions. From our perspective, RWS token is pioneers’ especial offer. And in future, we will focus on other types of RWS tokens with monthly and other types of limitations of using Robonomics Web Services for Robotics and IoT devices.\n\n## Conclusion\nRobonomics Web Services is the new branch of evolution in Robonomics project. Earlier, we only said we have Software platform, Decentralized network Providers, and some use cases based on our technologies. From now on Robonomics project made step on the way to bring something at least as good as Amazon Web Services but on the top of new internet technologies wave. It still R&D and experimental, but pioneers who would like to be the first in new fields are welcome! More Services in RWS IoT Core and not only in core will be presented this summer. Alpha version will start as soon as possible.\n\nStay tuned and [follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/logo.62c183a.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/logo.9ea8d39.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg 480w","/assets/static/logo.6b2ed88.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg 1024w","/assets/static/logo.62c183a.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-6b764ee1cef39db20c215d9eea1221fe'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-6b764ee1cef39db20c215d9eea1221fe)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAUACP/EACoQAAEEAQMEAQIHAAAAAAAAAAECAwQRAAUSIRMxQVFhcYEUFSIjM0KR/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/8QAGxEAAgMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECESExsfD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/APVOIF2pQo/px8Va0oQparpIs0L7YBBpz0l%2bIlyZGTGeJUC2lzqAAEgG6HcUfvkzt9Je2ro1fbMpSWdbjRZ8WbJbjbeojYFNlXINkEA%2bCKI85qJWHOokWNp2kkfAPH%2b4FVgWb6SN1XtF12wrKgklCdx9XV4pWG1NNncSrgEDjgefWZGpOQNJ0XUJ%2brTH/wAvSDIdWtSz00jniua%2bBgq502k3XPfDmNprUNiTGVAZeU2%2bzvS6XVqTtPI4Ufp88/XNnBqcVF57s7ASdwocYcR9pD7LjTgttaSlQ9gijgwU9TOoh%2bANN/CdIvgSuvu3dLab2V/a678VedrLs1OkS16O20/PS2Sy2tVJUrwCceBp0WBCjRIrWxiOP2klRVt7%2bTz5OWSAlCtoANessXVMklaaK%2bnPSF6dHc1BpMeUpALje4K2KrkWOD9sYIVJRIalJZUyq0AJJNpI53ejk4AUgbgDx6yvNgRpsR%2bLJb3MP/yJBKd3byOfAxeh3WFlA2gACgBQGHI2mUMsNstim0JCUi7oAcZJkCP/2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"The ultimate guide to Robonomics, RWS and Robonomics parachain on Polkadot","path":"/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/","date":"February 25, 2021","description":"This article delves into the connection between Robonomics platform, its parachain on the Polkadot ecosystem and the Robonomics Web Services (RWS)","content":"\nTaking into account the never-ending discussions on the backbone operation of Robonomics, let’s investigate the under the hood structure and outline the main pillars of the network. This article delves into the connection between Robonomics platform, its [parachain](https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-parachain-on-kusama-40853780c709) on the Polkadot ecosystem and the [Robonomics Web Services](https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-web-services-and-rws-token-intro-d730ab50ad42) (RWS).\n\nThe Robonomics Network consists of multiple [repositories of code](https://github.com/airalab) that can be used separately in implementation of a fully-fledged IoT application. If you plan on connecting your smartphone for example to an IoT device, it is not enough to develop an app and link a bunch of sensors to it. Instead, you have to carry out a [chain of actions](https://blog.aira.life/simple-iot-scheme-990224363803) that will eventually lead to a connected IoT device and interconnected elements of the infrastructure, enabling the signal from the device to reach you.\n\n## The chronology of the Robonomics Network development\n\nSo how did the idea to create the [Robonomics parachain](https://parachain.robonomics.network/#/explorer) and [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/land/say-hello-to-robonomics/) came about? Originally, back in 2015–2017, we started with the development of a quite complicated solution we called the [Economy of Robots](https://blog.aira.life/the-first-in-the-economy-of-robots-6f4bb115643b). We are confident it is exactly what smart cities, industry 4.0 and the development of the IoT apps will come to.\n\nOur primary goal was to create software for cyber-physical systems that can manage autonomous and independent devices within the technical and economic transactions framework. Therefore, we decided to generate a technical and economy biased transaction and make it serve as a foundation for the development of more complicated processes.\n\nOne of my favourite scenarios of the Economy of Robots is called [Smart Building Offsetting](https://new.dapp.ipci.io/#/offsetting). It is a service that allows an autonomous building to collect and aggregate information on its energy consumption and then communicate it to another agent within the Robonomics Network, and even request carbon footprint offset services. In turn, the agent verifies the location of the building, works out an applicable coefficient of CO2 emissions and then synchronizes this data with a partner project [DAO IPCI](http://ipci.io/), to determine the number of carbon credits from the green finance market that are required to offset the building’s carbon footprint. These operations were successfully executed on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n### The solution to the problem\n\nToday, the Economy of Robots that we managed to build back in 2017 with our colleagues and partners, comprises a complicated at first glance chain, that acts as a final turn of the IoT industry evolution. The biggest issue we had was that we were amassing all the knowledge and realised our ideas, without having a chance to pass them on to anyone. Every new [scenario of the Economy of Robots](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/r-and-d-based-on-robonomics-network/), created during the development of Robonomics Network platform, was making the end product that little bit more complicated to understand for people foreign to the matter. In other words, one must be acquainted with multiple competencies and spend years to grasp the thinking behind intersecting disciplines that form the concepts of economy and machines working together.\n\nWhen you start to understand the nuances behind the development of an IoT application, it quickly becomes apparent that technical specialists must spend years to reach a fully functioning product stage. This is why we decided to turn potential users of our platform into co-developers. We focused on teaching them to become professional IT engineers in the IoT application space and as a result, we created Robonomics parachain and Robonomics Web Services.\n\n![DAO IPCI with Robonomics network](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-network.jpg)\n\n\n## Introduction to Robonomics Web Services\n\nIt is clear that the Economy of Robots is interesting to the public. Nevertheless, the main problem is that after a short while these users still flock to Amazon Web Services for IoT devices and start using that instead, without figuring out the critical advantages that the Robonomics Network carries compared to the renowned IT giants. This brought us to the conclusion that we cannot be about promises of completing something in the future without providing a real product here and now.\n\nTherefore, we decided that a range of real services must be provided to our potential users. Services similar to what other cloud platforms are offering but better. As a result, we created Robonomics Web Services, a product built on our in-house protocols and platform that uses an open-source robotics framework (ROS). We then dedicated 2 years to the development of the key functions that I will now delve into in greater detail.\n\n### The key functions of RWS:\n\n**1. Subscription**\n\nThe standard approach to blockchain services always includes transaction costs known as transaction fees or transaction gas. This means that when you make a transaction, its priority is dependent on the cost or fee that you are ready to pay for it. The higher the fee you pay, the faster your transaction will be processed. Such a model is not suitable for systems that rely on guaranteed bandwidth. You have to be absolutely sure that your device will be able to make a transaction at the set time and a predictable cost. This is something we don’t see often today, as transaction costs are fully dependent on the fluctuation of the exchange rates, at times reaching $50 in cost.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we have created a Subscription service, which is an alternative cost model on the Robonomics parachain for Polkadot. It guarantees execution of a prepaid number of transactions and assigns them a higher priority compared to transactions that are paid through fee model. To learn more about the difference between monthly Subscription and XRT tokens you can revert to my ‘[Heterogeneous tokenomics](https://blog.aira.life/rws-overview-part-2-heterogeneous-tokenomics-afc209cc855)’ article, whilst my other piece planned to be released at the end of December will outline the final architecture and interconnection of the two models.\n\nOur Subscription model does not only solve the guaranteed transitioning problem but also only costs $10 per device, making it an extremely profitable offering for the end-user. Moreover, it provides a stable bandwidth for thousands of monthly transactions, which is quite a stellar achievement.\n\n**2. Launch**\n\nLaunch is a very simple but economical function from the usage of computing power and blockchain point of view. It allows you to turn on or off your device and change its binary setting from 1 to 0 and back by sending a request to it in the form of a transaction. Since there isn’t much complexity attached to this function, let’s move to the next critical pillar.\n\n**3. Datalog**\n\nThis function works with telemetry and therefore requires me to expand on it. It works in two modes where you either save your IPFS hashes or store data on the chain.\n\nSo how do you use these modes? The on-chain datalog function is applicable when your data size is below four variables. There is simply no point in saving a chunk of data this small on IPFS (off chain), as bytes wise this on-chain log won’t be incrementally larger than the IPFS hash. We suggest recording the entire raw data inflow as a single function or opting for the IPFS hash. Then, Robonomics as a platform for developers will process the recorded data, be it raw or in form of an IPFS hash and decide where to write it to. This datalog processing will be hidden from the end-user and he/she won’t even notice the difference between two different types of storage.\n\n‘Liability’ is our final function but it won’t be released to the public until we know the goals that large scale Economy of Robots projects pursue. Another milestone product for us that we are working on is aimed at [Robot as a Service](https://blog.aira.life/what-is-robonomics-network-robot-as-a-service-and-future-parachain-of-polkadot-or-something-more-36deece9f3cb) framework, or as we call it, the ‘contractually obliged robot’ on Ethereum. [This infrastructure](https://blog.aira.life/robots-under-robonomics-control-overview-39337ac9fbbb) has already been described in full detail in our knowledge hub and implies a situation where the end-user uses our service tokens without relying on XRT or other tokens to pay for parachain usage.\n\n![The key functions of Robonomics Web Services (RWS)](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-rws.jpg)\n\n## What is the connection between RWS and the Economy of Robots?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the goals behind Robonomics Web Services is to educate our users and turn them into co-developers who understand the Economy of Robots. We believe that there is nothing complicated about this task as long as the user gets acquainted with the basic functionality discussed above.\n\n### Digital Twins\n\nNext step in applying the instruments provided by Robonomics Web Services is to learn how to create a Digital Twin, otherwise known as a Digital Shadow for the app. It acts as a digital version of the real-world equipment and copies all of its technical characteristics.\n\nWhat does this mean I hear you ask! Let’s take an intricate structure of sensors that measure the air quality as an example. You cannot make them do measurements every 5 seconds because their internal calibration and balancing of measured data takes 2 minutes. This is where a Digital Twin comes in, allowing us to make an app that is responsive to the user’s commands.\n\nAccording to the [Gartner report on IoT market trends](https://www.gartner.com/en/innovation-strategy/trends/iot-adoption-trends), 85% of the companies that were part of the study have already implemented or plan to implement Digital Twins over the course of the next year. Most of these companies have in-house engineering teams that work on proprietary solutions. Nevertheless, they all acknowledge that they have to rely on already existing solutions to be able to scale quickly and keep their services adaptable to the constantly changing IoT industry environment.\n\nThis is why our parachain on the Robonomics Network doesn’t only offer the aforementioned functions that are not available on Ethereum IPFS, but also allows our users to create Digital Twins of their devices.\n\nWe are developing this feature to let users build their own Digital Twins, interpret them on web services/IoT apps and most importantly save them as a model that will write the datalog. Our [Wiki](http://wiki.robonomics.network/) is being constantly updated with all the required knowledge to execute the aforementioned solutions and will soon be complete with basic information that explains a Digital Twin build from A to Z.\n\n### Applying Digital Twins\n\nOnce the data processing model is finalised and your Digital Twin is fully structured, you have to decide what will be its relation to the web service or an IoT application.\n\nAnalytics is often the common choice for such digital service, where a sensor sends you the data it measures (updates its digital copy). This data will most likely be subject to post-processing since it is highly unlikely that you are interested in the Pascals pressure value inside of your country house heating system. Instead, you need to know whether the temperature in the house is right and whether the heating system is still on. You basically have to decide how to apply the digital twin of the data that you saved on it and this is where additional services can help.\n\nNow, we shift to a complex scenario of Smart Building Offsetting, where a copy of energy consumption data acts as a digital twin. Let’s say that you want to save energy consumption data for a given flat and use the Datalog function with IPFS storage for it. If you are looking to find out the total amount of consumed energy, you would save it on-chain. Opposingly, imagine that we run a digital twin of the smart building. The Offsetting Service will frequently ask this digital twin to provide various data on energy consumption, then store it and after performing off chain calculations, connect/talk to Robonomics in order to provide required services.\n\nWe gathered such services in a specialised [marketplace](https://robonomics.app/#/services) that acts as an App Store for robots.\n\n![Decentrilized application, dapp in Robonomics network](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-dapp.jpg)\n\n## Understanding the Marketplace\nIn order to implement a model of interconnected digital twins and services, we must create a delivery medium for it or in other words an app on your smartphone. This marketplace, built on a decentralised ledger in face of decentralised applications, can be used to duplicate and create individual copies and digital twins for any required purpose out there via predefined templates. Most importantly, this is done without intermediaries and external storage, making our IoT services marketplace censor and centralized link free.\n\nLast but not least, let’s talk about the user interface. We strive to always offer our users most up to date online technologies and therefore grant access to decentralized applications. The greatest feature you get during the development of your Dapp, is the lack of vulnerabilities on your side. Whilst your app is on IPFS, it is connected to the ENS registry or the Polkadot ecosystem registry and hence the user is not faced with the vulnerability of dealing with a substituted app or a request when following the hyperlink. It is simply very convenient from the point of view of end-user application development and its maintenance.\n\nAnother advantage of decentralised applications is peer-to-peer communication. In other words, your app can communicate to its digital twin, the IoT service and the end-user application without a single point of signal decline, eliminating the need for third parties and intermediary resources when a task needs to be executed. This is what the [robonomics.js](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-js) is for, used in the development of [Dapp Robonomics](https://robonomics.app/#/). We are currently in the process of adding a new iteration of improvements and will soon release a Robonomics Stylebook (an interface guide based on web3.js and polkadot.js functions), leaving you with an easy job of structuring your application right. As a result, we complete the full Economy of Robots chain.\n\n![Robonomics Network](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-network-2.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n* Our goal is to make [robots part of the economy](https://blog.aira.life/the-first-in-the-economy-of-robots-6f4bb115643b) but first, we need to teach the user on how everything works and set up.\n* To aid the purpose, we have created the [Robonomics Web Services](https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-web-services-and-rws-token-intro-d730ab50ad42) product that allows users to build apps and services together with us (subscription, launch, datalog).\n* Subscription to RWS resolves all transaction-related issues and adds functions that include: turning device on/off, telemetry (storage of a digital twin).\n* Once you create a digital twin via in-house templates, you can develop an IoT service and add it to our [marketplace](https://robonomics.app/#/services). The pre-structured interfaces in Dapp are used as a delivery mechanism that take your service to the end-user.\n* [Dapp](https://robonomics.app/) serves as a bulletproof way to establish a peer-to-peer (direct) communication with a digital twin, even when the service stops to operate. Regardless of the external circumstances, the market will never fail to work.\n* The aforementioned chain is a pathway to the Economy of Robots described in this article.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robonomics-logo.62c183a.55ad49b8c05f517a00fbc467115a9fba.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robonomics-logo.9ea8d39.55ad49b8c05f517a00fbc467115a9fba.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robonomics-logo.6b2ed88.55ad49b8c05f517a00fbc467115a9fba.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robonomics-logo.62c183a.55ad49b8c05f517a00fbc467115a9fba.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-24e45ff202d7d386192acd71c5641286'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-24e45ff202d7d386192acd71c5641286)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgABAAMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwQFBgIDCP/EADMQAAIBAgUCBAQDCQAAAAAAAAECBAMRAAUGEiEHMRMUIkEIUWFxIzKBFRYkU5GhscHw/8QAGAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMEBQb/xAAmEQACAQQABgEFAAAAAAAAAAABAgADESExBAUSE1HBQSIjcYGR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwAs0nkOVy45mzplCe60qjnJ4zVklMRwtmWmwHsflyLkYgVMpV9R0qVeBNyfLZNYimssNuRAORvZRuP1t7jF70r0bqbVE6RW0tK8n5YrTkV1kmk6q3Nhbk/l7fbHHqfp/VOmcxg0NYzas5X31I26Y1b0ggN35Unj/hi1WAqZzBqKWQgGx8yRrTI9NQ9NwJ%2bQTP44VfBkx2qFi1wTuAPItYcjjnGVgNuqIouSSAAO5x0LTq5nbytM7qZAPiyB7j23EfLEmJDzCKwq0lRKincHEincfbnvhrVAXvr8RKoy0wuyB8%2b5rMpZabkO%2bx1JBRgb8fPCHpuSt15wTR2n1q3iyCj1qjEF3rpdiO9%2be/198bPIsxqQWUSAn4i%2bnbUVrf0vhtNxJa9M21HvIKitRQ2BF7MT7Yv40pGYoD29/ngz0zmrVKSpSDPYXsoJsMaiLN2MWII%2b4thjIp2ZlVUbFhDP4dI3kdNSpsKaWeZW2yKYXaaLJcKAfe6sCT9QPniD8R8ZJcPLMynzT4ser5ajRKkmqrepyWHbaFH3v88F%2bjdZT9KQJ4gXc1npkK7fhqebkrbkkC3ccYj601fO1VTy9p5KmgjAqGuhbd%2bYC3BtYe/bHHLy3jhzU8Wan29WudW8a38/u07PvUux27fVKCf%2bzzHPgcVva4Y/54wo9E%2bj%2bXdQ9NTMzm5nKh1KEwxglJEKkBFa/IJv6sDtc2BwozdcyOl0SHkOn49QeJRWVJr%2bbqp41VwPVtU2WwAFue2NlnCMEvk%2bpMUZlLgYHuWHW3pPl/TjTWX5pBzOZLaVKEcpIRFAGxmv6R39ODjIcxIclW4W30xr4mu6/VGVR01qSLUajVBaPWEyqxjVQLLUCsSDwSLcXB7jBrFRok%2bvHD7vDqNTLWtusbdv0wdGuBU6Dm3uA9JjT6/OP5aeiukOd1f3ojR6cerXSvSdGdSR4YtfcbA8cf3wjZlXopUzM1qj0VMlLsLMb%2bFwLAA8/Xn9MGvQ6ky5Fm%2bY0WVZNOtQjhiXB2vyR6WX3GNPqTMpEiTn1CQQzUp9Kzgt/KtYAk2H%2b74oy9SSuoVMT//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Trajectory of Robonomics Development 2021, Part 1","path":"/blog/roadmap-2021/","date":"February 18, 2021","description":"The Polkadot architecture is becoming explicit and complete, which should allow us, as parachain developers, to shift our focus from maintaining improvements in Polkadot dependencies (the substrate framework, cumulus and other), and move on to increasing the functionality of our parachain.","content":"\nStarting with this article, I would like to share the tasks that the core project development team are ready to share with the community today.\n\nIn total, we have counted about [20 tasks](https://github.com/orgs/airalab/projects/7) that we are willing to implement this year. Some of them are full-fledged tasks, while the second part rather reflects the fact that the core developers devote time to this area, for example, supporting the academic community, conducting dev camps and developing Internet resources around the project.\n\nToday I will share the development team plans related to task #1 - launching parachain on the Kusama network.\n\n## Task #1: Parachain on Kusama\nLeads: [@ensrationis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0c53yygAAAAJ&hl=en), [@akru](https://github.com/akru)\n\n![\"Robonomics Parachain on Kusama first\"](./images/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/Robonomics_Parachain-web.jpg)\n\nEarlier, we presented a general vision of development in the Polkadot ecosystem - [Robonomics Parachain on Kusama first, Robonomics Relay Chain on Polkadot is a vision](https://robonomics.network/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/). Now let's add more details.\n\n### Rococo > Kusama > Polkadot \n\nOn December 31, 2020, [the Robonomics release \"Rococo V1 support\"](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v0.22.0) for testing the parachain in the main Polkadot testnet Rococo v1 was published. During January - February 2021, we continue to improve the Robonomics code merging new commits associated with the restarts of Rococo Relay Chain. To test the operation of the Robonomics parachain, the developers keep our own fork of Rococo Relay Chain up to date, so the issue of connecting our parachain to the public network is rather a question of (1) public proof of the project's compatibility with the ecosystem, (2) the possibility of conducting tests with other projects from the ecosystem - Phala, Acala, Moonbeam, Darwinia etc - to search for collaborative implementations using the now available XCMP in Rococo v1.\n\n### Kusama Slot Auction\n\nAhead of us are tasks related to participation in the auction of slots of the Kusama network. First, we need to figure out the implementation of this mechanism. Of course, we have been studying the theory for a long time, but the practice of participating in the auction will open up new tasks for the team. In any case, we will try to rehearse the auction and share the results with the community through a blog post.\n\n### Democracy, Treasury and others parachains modules\n\nIn addition to participating in the auction, the developers are in the discussion of the following issues regarding the launch of the parachain on the Kusama network:\n\n* What modules from the standard and used in the Polkadot / Kusama network can be useful to developers and the community after the launch of the parachain?\n* How are we going to launch parachain: follow the scenario from root privileges for the main developers to democracy, or …\n* How many XRT tokens should be transferred from Ethereum to Kusama and then to Polkadot?\n* The minimum inflation parameters in the Robonomics network for the successful launch of the staking mechanism at the start of the parachain.\n* …\n\nOf course, there are more questions, but these ones will most likely be interesting for the community in the first place and we think about them as a priority.\n\n### Specific Functions of Robonomics Parachain\n\nWhile speaking about the launch of the parachain, we must understand its main and special functions, which open up new possibilities of the Polkadot network to a certain group of users. Robonomics will provide the ability to manage smart devices connected to the Internet using the Robonomics Web Services (short: RWS) functionality, and we will also implement the functionality already tested on the Ethereum network for the emerging robot economy - smart contracts for the provision of automated services. Thus, Robonomics aims to help the entire Polkadot ecosystem increase the capabilities of each project separately towards deep integration with the IoT market.\n\nTo date, the possibility has already been implemented (1) to enable, disable and transfer the IoT task to the device / robot through the Robonomics parachain; (2) to receive device telemetry directly through the parachain or in a combination of IPFS + parachain for big data, and (3) a parachain subscription mechanism with guaranteed bandwidth.\n\nAhead of us is the implementation of such functionality as:\n \n1. Robobank to accept any Polkadot token in automation services\n2. Single version of True via Digital Twins on Blockchain\n3. Bitcoin payments for real estate\n4. Privacy of using IoT applications\n5. global supply chains on blockchain\n6. DeFi connectivity for IoT\n7. NFT for IoT\n\nAs you can see, tasks such as (3), (4), (6), (7) are of particular interest, since they imply integration with other parachains in order to utilize their useful functions in Robonomics.\n\nLet us see the power of a common ecosystem of many specific projects!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Polkadot architecture is becoming explicit and complete, which should allow us, as parachain developers, to shift our focus from maintaining improvements in Polkadot dependencies (the substrate framework, cumulus and other), and move on to increasing the functionality of our parachain.\n\nIt is important not to forget that the process of racing for a parachain slot is an internal development process, but most importantly - a specific functionality of a parachain; the main thing is to provide Robonomics functions to other parachains and implement the use of other parachains in your code. Then the entire ecosystem will be able to provide interesting functionality to users; functionality that will be extremely difficult to find outside of Polkadot.\n\nIn the next article I will talk about the Robobank project, the improvements of the Substrate based client of the Robonomics Network, as well as our plans for the development of Robonomics dapp and Robonomics Web Services.\n\n*ensrationis*","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/1.62c183a.0b4ff580eb7c82adac28c73dc00bebfe.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":676},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/1.9ea8d39.0b4ff580eb7c82adac28c73dc00bebfe.jpg 480w","/assets/static/1.6b2ed88.0b4ff580eb7c82adac28c73dc00bebfe.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/1.62c183a.0b4ff580eb7c82adac28c73dc00bebfe.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 676' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-1f9662d6eabf25685ee3634f4576381c'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-1f9662d6eabf25685ee3634f4576381c)' width='1500' height='676' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2ba076R6ij6moJa6mpZ4aPumOGSXAMwHlgB4GcjnTmod0gkaKMySAEqgIG444GT41jtJ8VqmK2U7w2y0ww7dqx/NlduM/tCceNLLv8UpFo5q2Wy2ibOGZFuTh28AHbt9j/wB6s/QceTCUDPiFYFbQwbqyUEpTpqecVutM7SQo0iGOQgbkJBwfbI0TWAL8W56WommjtNhV0yzMbq%2bSTnwCnP8Ar3Gh3P4%2b11DT942izzA%2bBFcWZjwPTZ/y/o66o7N7SWYDYn9h1pi819pn0rUa%2b5Vly6lnt1PdTaoYJVpo%2b1CsktRMYu631AhVC49OTnnTXpa4VdStwo7k0clZb6j5d5o12rKCqurY9Dhhke41VQLp1RFYr/QrJQr%2bGvWE0wjd3mkVQI1L8Z2jG4jVy6bt9Pbrd2YO6ZWbu1DTOHlaVgCxcjgt48ceMcajuILZKFZi1V31M%2bHT3YkgWESDqSYm40vnpFLurL9HQQVMVNA9TcIotyx9s7cMD5bGBnGq70NUUr3CWChpIDSVGRUbKQxjcAMD2Pnx7c%2burPL0vDJXVtUK2sD1T72BZWCELtGzIO3Az/Op9is1NZaZ4aQyFXYMxdskkKFz/AGisNBIKfN%2bfS9R21PSQrynrblQvw22fNdk2mkGRw3YTB/rS%2b%2b2%2bx03aMslpt4UksJIIcyceBv8a5u9bUVd7ktcMz0sMMKzSSRH9STcThQf2jjnyTn00FLLSxY%2bVjihPq3aV2Y%2b5Zskn7nS75ziPvVBvBtJALtpvA6/w1ItVt6erYt1PDaqz8q52Qwtg%2bpO0eTolVaunqcMr2%2bzRzFSyrJDGuf68Z1CkstJIWaaNGkPKyRoInQ4xkMmDnk6LY6iSW71dqritX8vCk0c8qDftYn8p45xjz/Ojv3OI%2b9FzCogqaOV7/L8q7NBNLaO7a1gSvijEfZp5AEIHIT2H/uk3SV9kuF5igWOop1lTvOZY1UtlcqOM5JGftgavQjCDEYVfsMaX2SyU1oaU0uf1VUOWZmJK55yScDn6RwNIFkAga1kIBua/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Parachain Lease Offering","path":"/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/","date":"October 26, 2020","description":"Robonomics developers aim to allocate $720,000 for a 2-year lease of a slot in the Kusama network.

This underlying amount of XRT will be distributed among the KSM holders who will support the project with their tokens at the upcoming auction of Polkadot’s wild cousin.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that this offer will be 1.5 times more profitable compared to KSM staking. Moreover, during the period of the next 2 years, we will be preparing for the Polkadot slot auction that is expected to be set within the $ 3.2-6.4 million price range.\n\nBelow you will find the calculations and explanation of our chosen strategy with regards to the Kusama auction in 2020 and the Polkadot auction in 2022.\n\n![\"Robonomics Parachain on Kusama first\"](./images/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/Robonomics_Parachain-web.jpg)\n## Robonomics Parachain on Kusama first\n\nAs the Polkadot ecosystem makes its first steps, we understand that our goals must take into account not only the network’s final architecture, but also all important milestones in the future development of the network. We, the Robonomics developers team, believe that Kusama will serve as the primary pillar of Polkadot development in the upcoming 2 years, and hence, it is the Kusama network that we would like to concentrate all our efforts on.\n\n> “Kusama first” is our development strategy in the Polkadot ecosystem for the next 2 years.\n\nAccording to preliminary estimates, one slot of the Kusama network is enough to service up to 10,000 [digital twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin) of IoT devices at once with a subscription price of less than $10 per month. This will allow Robonomics to debug the process of connecting IoT systems during the lease of the Kusama slot. Next, we will be ready to scale the network to 1 million IoT systems connected in real-time by transforming the Robonomics network from Kusama Parachain to Polkadot Relay Chain.\n\n![\"Robonomics Relay Chain on Polkadot is the vision\"](./images/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/Robonomics_Relay_Chain-web.jpg)\n## Robonomics Relay Chain on Polkadot is the vision\n\nBy the time the Polkadot network is technically ready to accept 100 parachain projects, and the Kusama network is successfully connected as a parachain in the Polkadot slot, Robonomics will be ready to introduce its own parachain of parachains to multiply the bandwidth. Based on our estimates, the Robonomics Relay Chain will allow the Polkadot network to serve up to 1 million IoT systems simultaneously with a subscription price of $2.\n\n## Initial Parachain Offering and Robonomics Parachain Lease Offering\nWe recommend reading the following articles before continuing: [Obtaining a Parachain Slot on Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/obtaining-a-parachain-slot-on-polkadot/) and [Polkadot Parachain Slots](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-parachain-slots/).\n\nOur goal in this article is to outline a fair price for the Robonomics Parachain Lease Offering in 2020 based on the following factors:\n* Existing parameters of the launched Kusama and Polkadot networks;\n* The forecast of Parity developers and the Web3 Foundation team;\n* Community expectations versus current DOT and KSM staking rates.\n\nThe capitalization of the Kusama and Polkadot networks is estimated at $300 million and $4 billion respectively. At the moment, both networks have identical parameters: 10% inflation, 50% as target stake in the Relay chain and 100 parachains as the target number of projects in shared security. Given this data, we can estimate the 2-year slot lease in the Kusama network at $480,000, and $3,200,000 in the Polkadot network.\n\n> You can find our in-depth calculations here: [Robonomics Parachain strategy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LkKYNzwNABv6SQfCkZwRi99XW47xg6eR1-tdtp5CQIQ/).\n\nNow, let’s try to sequentially perform a follow-up calculation in the table below:\n\n### Step 1: Calculating the size of the KSM and DOT market available for auctions\n\nLet’s consider that the number of KSM and DOT within an ideal stake will always be blocked by the community. Then, we subtract it from the most realistic amount of cryptocurrency in constant circulation and presume that the trading volume equals to 10% of the total token circulation.\n\n| Total KSM: 10,000,000  | Total DOT: 1,000,000,000 |\n| - | - |\n| - 50% ideal stake ( -5,000,000 KSM)  | - 50% ideal stake ( -500,000,000 DOT)  |\n| - 10% trade balance ( -1,000,000 KSM)  | - 10% trade balance ( -100,000,000 DOT)  |\n| ** 4,000,000 KSM ** | ** 400,000,000 DOT ** |\n\n4,000,000 KSM and 400,000,000 DOT - the size of the available cryptocurrency for bonding to parachains.\n\n> Please note, that due to inflation, the total number of tokens will experience a year on year increase, but to simplify calculations, we do not take into account the increase in total supply. Moreover, we believe that the growth rate itself will not be significant enough in the first couple of years.\n\n### Step 2: Estimating the expected return on the staking of KSM and DOT\n\nThe current inflation rate of 10% per year can be revised next year using the on-chain governance function, but we assume that this indicator will not be revised in the next 1.5-2 years. This means that the holders of KSM and DOT tokens can expect the return from the IPO of Polkadot projects to be at the level of 20% per annum. Resultantly, we can now calculate the expected return:\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Kusama shared security cost</th>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Polkadot shared security cost</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Target bond, KSM</td>\n            <td>4,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Target bond, DOT</td>\n            <td>400,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n         <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, $</td>\n            <td>$48,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>$640,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\nAs you can see, with the current capitalization of the Kusama and Polkadot networks, the parachains should in total, generate KSM and DOT token holders, a return of about $50,000,000 and $650,000,000 respectively every 2 years.\n\n> ** Compound or simple interest in the calculation? **\n\n> We do not believe that the formula of compound interest of staking reward accumulation is worth using and is applicable at this time. Robonomics and other parachains will offer DOT and KSM blocking schemes, where the reward will be accumulated either in full at the beginning of the slot lease, or in part during the entire lease period, whilst the funds themselves will be transferred to the address of the holder without restricting access to them. This means that making calculations based on simple interest is more realistic and more convenient.\n\n### Step 3: Estimating the cost of shared security for one parachain slot\nPolkadot developers are aiming to set 100 parachains with 1,000 validators within the Kusama and Polkadot Relay chains. Therefore, in our calculations, the Robonomics developers propose to take into account the target division of the shared security cost. This, in turn, means that the expected return from blocking KSM and DOT tokens is divided into 100 projects in our calculations.\n\nIn this case, we arrive to almost the same indicators of the network security annual costs, as mentioned in the article [Polkadot Parachain Slots](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-parachain-slots/) (~$200,000 per year). Of course, this relates only to the Kusama network, since the cost of Polkadot shared security is already high today ($3,200,000 per year). Nevertheless, given the transition of Robonomics to the Relay Chain state, we will be able to afford these security expenses and thereby provide the IoT market with the most secure globally accessible network in the world, the protection of which is already estimated at $4 billion.\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Kusama shared security cost</th>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Polkadot shared security cost</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Target bond, KSM</td>\n            <td>4,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Target bond, DOT</td>\n            <td>400,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, $</td>\n            <td>$48,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>$640,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parachains, total</td>\n            <td>100</td>\n            <td>Parachains, total</td>\n            <td>100</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Shared security cost annual per parachain</td>\n            <td>$240,000.00</td>\n            <td>Shared security cost annual per parachain</td>\n            <td>$3,200,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Lease period, month</td>\n            <td>24</td>\n            <td>Lease period, month</td>\n            <td>24</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected reward per parachain</td>\n            <td>$480,000.00</td>\n            <td>Expected reward per parachain</td>\n            <td>$6,400,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n## On-Chain Governance Strategy\n\nThe beginning of the Robonomics’ parachain existence will be supported with funds allocated by the developers’ DAO. In the future, we plan that commissions from the monthly subscription activations for digital twins of IoT systems will be accumulated on the On-Chain Treasury account (minus the commission of the collators and the further development fund). Funds from the treasury will be governed by the parachain technical committee for participation in the subsequent auctions of Kusama and Polkadot slots. Potentially, funds in the form of a 2-year commission should be sufficient enough to extend the slot lease after Robonomics transitions to the Relay Chain state.\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Robonomics Parachain on Kusama</th>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Robonomics Relay chain on Polkadot</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>tps</td>\n            <td>1,500.00</td>\n            <td>tps</td>\n            <td>300,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>block time</td>\n            <td>6</td>\n            <td>block time</td>\n            <td>4</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>IoT Monthly subscriptions, max</td>\n            <td>9,000.00</td>\n            <td>IoT Monthly subscriptions, max</td>\n            <td>1,200,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Subscription price</td>\n            <td>$10.00</td>\n            <td>Subscription price</td>\n            <td>$2.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>2 years leasing slot total commissions</td>\n            <td>$2,160,000.00</td>\n            <td>2 years leasing slot total commissions</td>\n            <td>$57,600,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, %</td>\n            <td>2%</td>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, %</td>\n            <td>2%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, total</td>\n            <td>$43,200.00</td>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, total</td>\n            <td>$1,152,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Treasury</td>\n            <td>$2,116,800.00</td>\n            <td>Treasury</td>\n            <td>$56,448,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td></td>\n            <td></td>\n            <td>Robonomics Relay chain validators incentive</td>\n            <td>$15,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\nCommission rates for collators will be determined by the democracy module, as well as inflation rates after the launch of the Robonomics Relay Chain.\n\n## Ecosystem strategy\n\nRobonomics is set to provide IoT devices with access to the Polkadot ecosystem, whilst Robonomics Parachains will store digital twins of these IoT devices. Within the parachain itself, users will be offered similar and even equivalent functions that are currently offered by other existing IoT cloud platforms such as AWS IoT, Azure IoT. In addition to standard IoT market functions implementations, for example, remote device launch and telemetry capture, Robonomics will be able to integrate with other projects in the eco-environment as they appear.\n\nWe believe that within 2 years, the list of available Polkadot ecosystem opportunities for the IoT market will be as follows:\n* Storage and management of cyber-physical systems’ digital twins in the Robonomics parachain;\n* Money for robots: integration of the most popular cryptocurrencies and tokens from the Polkadot ecosystem through XCMP;\n* Smart contracts for robots: access to smart contracts using a bridge to Ethereum and support for EVM in parachains such as Plasm, Moonbeam, Edgeware;\n* NFT identity for mobile robotics through projects such as Acala and Distributed Sky whitepaper;\n* Tokenization of data from IoT devices for the environmental liability market based on DAO IPCI;\n* A managed access to IoT systems using DAO for collective management of public, corporate and private spaces;\n* Robotics Smart leasing and bond issue for the installation of robots in smart cities with distribution in the DeFi market.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nRobonomics is an infrastructure project for the Polkadot network, which aims to place more than 1 million digital twins of IoT devices with a level of security and global availability that the cloud platforms operated by IT corporations cannot provide. Robonomics developers will provide integration for these digital twins with ecosystem projects and thereby open access to previously inaccessible tools for automation systems of city living, logistics and production, namely, direct access to fintech solutions without banks.\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-cover-web.62c183a.0a239770c06887970e47fe72652c3f12.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width:
