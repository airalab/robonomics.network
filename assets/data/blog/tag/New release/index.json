In the coming months, the project R&D team will devote itself to integrations with the Statemine, Karura, Moonriver, Crust and KILT parachains.\n\nWe took the first steps towards parachain communication 1.5 years ago, [demonstrating the exchange of messages between two blockchains](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/cross-chain-messages/) during a master class in St. Petersburg. Last year, [Gav published a series of articles in which XCMP was modified](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format-3b77b1373392) - it was turned into cross-consensus messaging (XCM) and received it’s first version number above zero.\n\nTwo months after the refactoring of XCM, the Robonomics team have now completed our tests on Rococo and we are ready to integrate with other parachains in the Kusama ecosystem.\n\n## Basic support for XCM in Robonomics\n\nAdhering to the view that Kusama itself is a heterogeneous network, the Robonomics developers are trying to implement IoT/Robotics-specific functionality into the Robonomics parachain code.\n\nWe will maximize our usage of the features from other parachains which can help to implement smart home/city or industrial scenarios when possible. For example, this year we plan to use the existing solutions of other parachains (not create our own solutions for): (1) personal balances of user access tokens, (2) dapp and IoT device user identification system, (3) large file storage, (4) use of IoT devices in work smart contracts.\n\nAt the time of the release of version 2.0, Robonomics is ready for integration with any parachain running on the Kusama network. The software implementation of XCM support can be found in [the alpha runtime directory](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/tree/master/runtime/alpha) of the main Robonomics repository on Substrate.\n\nIn May and June 2022, compatibility tests with the Relay chain were already carried out on Rococo network using the example of teleporting the native Rococo Relay Chain token - ROC (analogous to KSM, but on the Rococo test network) - to the Robonomics parachain.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BJHSFDZt0y4\n\n[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1534081132765097984)\n\nIf you have any ideas based on integrating Robonomics with other Kusama parachains, email research@robonomics.network or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/atduhWZpVr) for discussion in our main community channels.\n\n## Integration with Statemine\n\nThe main goal of our integration with Statemine is the full launch of the liability() function of the Robonomics parachain. The liability() function is quite similar to the main Robonomics function in Ethereum, which allows you to organize a full cycle - using a robot as a service. From the moment of integration with Statemine, developers of IoT applications will be able to create their own token in Statemine (or use any existing Statemine token) to launch a smart device/robot to execute a given program. After the user program is executed, the tokens will be automatically transferred to the balance of the robot.\n\nBack in spring, we showed a simple example of using tokens in Statemine to launch a coffee machine and described one of the scenarios of the tokenization development of access to equipment in the article: [Coworking for crypto-anarchists, p1](https://blog.aira.life/coworking-for-crypto-anarchists-p1-5ebecb252f2d). Accounting for the use of equipment in the office and differential distribution of access to equipment fits very well with access tokens in conjunction with the liability () function.\n\nAnother example of the use of Statemine integration with Robonomics, based on our existing use cases is the ability to use a telescope to mint NFT postcards. Today, user balances are stored in Statemine, and then NFTs are issued using RMRKs. Starting with our integration with Statemine, the telescope will be able to receive a task to create an image through the liability () function, and access tokens sent to the telescope will go to the balance of the telescope only after adding a link to NFT in the results of the liability () execution.\n\nWork status: Q3 2022\n\n## Integration with Karura\n\nAs long term builders on both the Ethereum and Dotsama ecosystems, Robonomics believes in integrating decentralized means of exchange for Robonomics parachain native token (XRT). Listing XRT on Karura swap is the ideal way to allow our token community to swap parachain native tokens in a decentralized way, and opening these HRMP communication channels is the first step in achieving that goal.\n\nOne of the ideas of Robonomics developers for further integration with Karura is automated currency and value exchange points for Kusama network tokens. We will share more about this separately, and certainly after the first step with the addition of XRT to Karura Swap.\n\nWork status: Q3 2022\n\n## Integration with Moonriver\n\nThe Robonomics parachain can become a universal mechanism for launching smart devices from within Moonriver smart contracts. We are currently working on this architecture and discussing a separate carbon footprint offset scenario using [DAO IPCI smart contracts](https://github.com/DAO-IPCI/DAO-IPCI) on the Moonriver parachain. \n\nWork status: Q3 2022\n\n## Integration with KILT\n\nOver the years of studying the robotics market, Robonomics developers have agreed that device identification is one of the most important tasks when considering complex scenarios for automating city life, logistics and industrial supply chains. KILT is an excellent example of continuing work towards integrating the functionality of various parachains within a heterogeneous network and solving problems that are significant for the IoT market.\n\nWork status: Q4 2022\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.1ffc44b851d313c35c5fe267555bfa2d.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.1ffc44b851d313c35c5fe267555bfa2d.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.1ffc44b851d313c35c5fe267555bfa2d.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.1ffc44b851d313c35c5fe267555bfa2d.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-335b1a1637208f41e97129a1fc282bcc'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-335b1a1637208f41e97129a1fc282bcc)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUABgEDBwj/xAAvEAABAwMCBQMDAwUAAAAAAAABAgMEAAUREiETIjFBUQZhkRQycQdSsSNCgaHR/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwEC/8QAIxEAAgICAQIHAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAEQMhMRIiMlFhgZHh8P/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A8%2bVmsVcPQXolfq5ma4i5MwvploQQtvWVagTn7hgDFNCVSxoSuWm1XC8S/pbTBkzZOkq4UdsrVgdTgUKhBUsJwR526ea6jGiQ/wBL/UymrxcJc6PLiaii3ANlZQ%2bCELJVlIJbyFpIUk4I7g87hyWmZQklKXP6hXw3STtnIycb79fx71UAY0TQmcnUoNCzAnUaFkDJHYkYyKnCcwo6F4SApXKdgehPtTO/3AXefInFplh15WtSGQdJUfuI8ZPNjyT5qPTUzIxiobe4iuFo0f3qSnTpIHUeD1qZO062I2DGrqS5ojj10fr5impR6bPc1loN2%2bWsukpb0tKOsjqBjqRih5USRELYlMOMlxOtGtONSc4yPIyD8VLhzR%2belXL1jcbHcrPBbt1thRJEdWkuRxgrQU5AUDud%2b5zvmqd2ouKwhbPMM61BAP7Sd8/66e9G%2bFHZXbleNn8feaQt4QeYVZYDEh5GtzhtblxwJyGxg7q6d9PzT1d8YVGEhyYyu4KQkLaRb06Ac8wznGAMkEDc/NIbu6Q45Da5I8denT%2b9XdR8n%2bKEiOIacDjjQdCTsgnAP59qSriJRIF0JZpUiyS55eeuz%2btakEqTbsIASTjlz87b0rlp%2bglInQHXBoWHGJCQOZYwdgM4OdXX4oWbJVKlqcUlKUpwhCEDCUJ7ACtNumLiOdNbLhCXGicBY/74PaoEANzWVVRiAbHnVRiPUt3bab4VyeQEnlQkJAQc5OkAYSPYYpRKkvS3eJJdU65vzK69Sf5JP%2baYXWGiKp1lJyGnCgHGM7E5Pk0prUFgRP/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics parachain updates, March’22","path":"/blog/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/","date":"March 17, 2022","description":"The Robonomics parachain was launched in January of this year, and our first publicly available progress report was published on January 18th in a blog post. Now, we will provide details of the work we have already performed within the task list","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\nimport UserForm from '~/components/blocks/UserForm.vue'\n\nThe Robonomics parachain was launched in January of this year, and our first publicly available progress report was published on January 18th [in a blog post](https://robonomics.network/blog/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/). Now, we will provide details of the work we have already performed within the task list as specified in the roadmap on Github: [Tracking issue for Robonomics Parachains on Kusama Launch #145](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/issues/145).\n\n## About the most important things in the work of the Robonomics parachain on Kusama in 2 months\n\n- The parachain is stable and has processed the first million extrinsics. The current network of collators also remains open with approximately [80 collators](https://telemetry.parachain.robonomics.network/#list/Robonomics). Anyone can [become a Robonomics collator](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/how-to-launch-the-robonomics-collator/) and receive rewards for preparing parachain block candidates and passing them to the Kusama validators.\n\n- [In the release 1.8.2](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.8.2), the sudo function was removed. The change was accepted by the parachain at the block [347,918](https://robonomics.subscan.io/block/347918). This means that the project development team no longer has the administrative functions of managing the parachain anymore.\n\n- [The technical committee](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/techcomm) completed the first update of the network protocol through the on-chain governance mechanism. In just 2 months, the technical committee has processed around 40 requests, such as exodus events, treasury proposals and runtime upgrades.\n\n- [Starting from the release 1.8.0](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.8.0), the Robot-as-a-service function is fully available. Using this function, you can combine the technical and economic parameters of launching an IoT device.\n\n- [The mechanism of IoT subscriptions in the Robonomics parachain](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/get-subscription/) has passed the stage of the first applications in real work scenarios. Now it has become the main functionality of the parachain, which the Robonomics developers plan to offer to home infrastructure owners.\n\n- The Winter school was suspended on February 24th. After 3 weeks, the developers decided to abandon the continuation of the school as an event. The Winter School lessons have been redesigned as an introductory Robonomics course, which will be available online 24/7 during 2022 from anywhere in the world. The course will be published on the [robonomics.academy website](https://robonomics.academy/) by the end of March.\n\n- An additional 1 XRT for crowdoan campaign participants who have a pioneer card [is available through the Robonomics dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/bonus-for-pioneer).\n\n## Parachain statistics for 2 months\n\nYou can find most of the statistics yourself on the Subscan.io block explorer at: [robonomics.subscan.io](https://robonomics.subscan.io)\n\n![Parachain statistics on Subscan.io](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/robonomics-parachain-subscan.jpg)\n\n### The Robonomics parachain processed 1 million transactions\n\nIt is more correct to say [extrinsics](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-protocol-info#extrinsics), but still we will sometimes use such assumptions for simplicity.\n\n![extrinsics for Robonomics](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/montly-extrinsics.png)\n\nThe daily load on the parachain today is from 10 to 25 thousands transactions per day. The datalog() function is mainly used to remotely collect data from IoT devices. Also, since February, the Robonomics developers have started using parachain IoT subscriptions for the first Robonomics scenarios of which we have been preparing for the past 2 years.\n\n![The daily load on the parachain today](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/robonomics-parachain-transactions.jpg)\n\nThe number of full Robonomics nodes that transmit to [the publicly available parachain telemetry service](https://telemetry.parachain.robonomics.network/#list/Robonomics) has doubled from 40 to 80 full network nodes. Anyone can [become a Robonomics collator](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/how-to-launch-the-robonomics-collator/) and receive rewards for preparing parachain block candidates and passing them to the Kusama validators.\n\n### The first Robonomics users\n\nAlready in early February, we had confidence that the Robonomics parachain was ready to accept it’s first users. Engaging early adopters always involves putting a lot of emphasis on training and helping out with whatever situation an early version user gets into. It is also a search for the most patient and responsive people who are interested in the technologies we use. Yes, there are always a few of them, and it is difficult to find them in more numbers than a couple of friends and work colleagues, but this is precisely the task we face in 2022. By creating a community of web3 + IoT power users ready to experiment for the sake of education, we will be able to ensure the exponential growth of the project in 2023-2024.\n\nThe main thing we want to do to attract the first users is to develop some training courses in 2022 that will not only be useful in terms of acquiring skills, but will also be interesting to complete.\n\nOf course, the Robonomics developers plan to organize contests and encourage the community for being active. However, we still believe that creativity/enthusiasm is stronger than the learning material we could provide. It's cool when, in the process of learning, you can try [to go through a black mirror](https://blackmirror.robonomics.academy/#/) and, while the QR code on the screen changes, remember any episode of the series of the same name or a scene from Philip K. Dick's book \"Ubik\", in which the main character quarrels with the door, to which he owes a couple of coins... In general, one of the main tasks of the team is to maintain a creative approach to user education in the future.\n\n![](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/blackmirror-lesson.jpg)\n\nThe Winter school [was suspended on February 24th](https://twitter.com/EnsRationis/status/1496885398404059136). Fortunately, you can still try the first lesson now! To do this, follow the link: [https://blackmirror.robonomics.academy/#/](https://blackmirror.robonomics.academy/#/)\n\nThose who have already completed the first lesson of the School in February may notice that the address of (D)app has changed. Now the lesson is available on the robonomics.academy domain, and soon all 5 lessons that we planned to conduct in the event format of the last week of February will be available online 24/7 in the Robonomics introductory course format. We will tell you about this separately.\n\n### The Robonomics releases on GitHub\n\nOver the past 2 weeks, there have been many releases of the Robonomics parachain client. The most relevant at the time of this writing is [1.8.4](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases).\n\n[Building the Robonomics parachain client](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/how-to-build-collator-node/) on Ubuntu 21.10 and running without any difficulties:\n\n![Building the Robonomics parachain client](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/building-client-for-robonomics-parachain.jpg)\n\nIn addition to system updates in releases, it is important to note the following improvements:\n\n- [Release 1.8.0](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.8.0) - added pallet liability, which allows you to fully implement the Robot-as-a-Service model and launch an IoT device with the transfer of technical and economic information in an atomic form.\n- [Release 1.8.2](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.8.2) - the superuser (sudo) has been removed from the Robonomics parachain. Already today, the Robonomics parachain does not have the possibility of direct control by the developers.\n\nYou can get acquainted with all the changes in the Robonomics parachain client at the link: [https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases)\n\n## The first stage of the roadmap 2022 is 90% completed\n\nBy the end of Q1 2022, the project team has completed almost all [the tasks to implement the basic functionality of the parachain](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/issues/145), and several Robonomics scenarios that previously worked only in test mode are already at the pilot stage.\n\n### The main task of Q2 2022 - XCM integrations\n\nAs you can see from [the Tracking issue for Robonomics Parachains on Kusama Launch #145](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/issues/145), the first part of the tasks has an item related to [XCMP](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/XCMP/index.html) implementation. We implemented the first tests with messaging between 2 instances of the Robonomics parachain during [a master class in St. Petersburg in the fall of 2020](https://youtu.be/zCH7RuIHEMg). It is the case howeever, that in past 1.5 years XCMP has undergone many changes, and now it is more correct to say [XCM (Cross-Consensus Message)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain).\n\nGavin Wood introduced the first version of XCM in the fall of 2021. XCM is well covered in three articles on medium:\n\n- [XCM: The Cross-Consensus Message Format](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format-3b77b1373392)\n- [XCM Part II: Versioning and Compatibility](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-part-ii-versioning-and-compatibility-b313fc257b83)\n- [XCM Part III: Execution and Error Management](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-part-iii-execution-and-error-management-ceb8155dd166)r\n\nAlready in February, we began to refine the Robonomics parachain in order to implement the first integration within the Kusama ecosystem. Our first task in this direction is integration with the Statemine parachain. This integration will allow users to use any statemine tokens to pay according to the Robot-as-a-Service model, for example, [when remotely controlling a telescope in the Atacama Desert](http://telescope.merklebot.com/) or to pay for items in a vending machine with tokens anywhere in the world.\n\nIn addition to integration with Statemine, plans for Q2 include:\n\n- Integration with Karura to add XRT/kUSD liquidity pool.\n- Integration with Moonriver to manage IoT devices using arbitrary solidity contracts.\n- Studying the technology of bridges between Ethereum and Kusama using the example of Darwinia.\n\nWe will describe each integration scenario separately based on the results of testing in Rococo, Westend or other sandboxes where Karura, Moonriver, Darwinia parachains have their own test versions.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nThere is complete chaos around us now, but the project team marked our trajectory for the web3 universe long ago - we publish the results of our work on the Internet so that experiments can be repeated anywhere in the world, because apart from open source code and access to the blockchain, you do not need anything more. Of course, life in the world of web3 is not so easy when it comes to a lot of details, but we can handle it. As engineers, we can imagine the consequences of militarization in the 21st century. The best thing that we all can do, with the current geopolitcal situations in mind, is to personally participate in peaceful projects and create as much open source software as possible for the tasks of ordinary people. Over the past year, our efforts have launched such projects as: an educational program for [remote control of the robotic dog Boston Dynamics](https://spot-sdk.education/); [remote observation of the starry sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up8hESnXnaY) from the most suitable place for this on the planet Earth - the Atacama Desert; [civil sensor network for monitoring the quality of the urban environment](https://airalab.org/en/air-monitoring) in the industrial city of Togliatti; [monitoring of water quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iCkdF2UJmo) in the canals of St. Petersburg. This year we will be focusing on smart home scenarios so you can [manage your home IoT infrastructure without the help of clouds](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/home-assistant-begin/).\n\nWe will share more with you in the next roadmap updates.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.2dda027cdaaedf053f61bff5d81e8041.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.2dda027cdaaedf053f61bff5d81e8041.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.2dda027cdaaedf053f61bff5d81e8041.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.2dda027cdaaedf053f61bff5d81e8041.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-9c72c2939326f9be396c478461340868'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-9c72c2939326f9be396c478461340868)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMBBAUAB//EAC4QAAICAQMDAQYGAwAAAAAAAAECAxEABBIhBTFRQQYiIzJhcRMUgZGh0TOx8P/EABgBAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDAgAE/8QAIBEAAgIBBAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECESEEEjFBA2GRgf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A8JCadzt3sG8uK/nEaiFoWpu2N72aokd8bFKn5e5IxKI22gPYBvtdfrlhcFw2H0fous6o/wABNsINGV%2bFH28n7YnqWli0/UZNNppWmVG2lytWfWs0tDr%2bsdRaTp%2bjDSXGaigATYq%2bo%2bnnGaT2a9oNOyzxdK1AdGBDnb7vqOD%2b95pbbyX1UtLHwKGmi3PtvH4krx3eWYM0LxahoWVldW2kMKIN1RHocZLpwke5WJ4sWKDC64zYm6f13rTnqZ0c2plmbcZhtuQjgmuL7cnKPUI9VpmMOrii08kih%2bTZZSTRFX4wlV4PDFN8mZnZLCj3B%2b2RgJYLBQfJ%2buOcfgaQq3DsbIPcccA/Wuf1w3ZY03xxorVww5I%2b13lOfvR5Y8lj3OcUci5EkSgHYA1gXukXuB61/wB%2b2SyfNbk%2bFLS2B47ZWXV0BcYNMGHvt6CvP0wz1C7%2bEbPH%2bZ/7yEozvF/SDTsYqKkQXdb%2bQ0g2jv2rtkypEsbuyiWuR78nA8cjErrwOHhLmqJMr/3gjWUtOhda2lTI1H%2bcNs/f0KYhyGdiq7VJ4W7rBw5HV2tECCvlBJ/3gZdcGz//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Update to Version 1.2: Staking, Tech Committee and Treasury","path":"/blog/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/","date":"September 17, 2021","description":"The project developers have implemented 2 important changes in the operation of the Robonomics parachain. The first is the inclusion of XRT staking, and the second is the launch of the first on-chain governance mechanisms.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Update 1.1: Staking\n\n### Theory\n\nDecentralized PoS networks ensure their security by locking the funds of the validators and all token holders on the network who participate in the selection of the validator pool. To reward validators and token holders, an analogous PoW reward model is usually used, based on the inflation + all commission fees in the block. This is how NPoS is implemented in Polkadot/Kusama.\n\n> Notably, both Ethereum and Polkadot include additional conditions for their reward models. Setting inflation targets, dividing the commission fees into several directions, and even burning a certain percentage of the commission fees are additional settings that both mature and newer networks are experimenting with in their implementations.\n\nParachains do not need staking in their core functionality. Parachains are secured by Relay Chain validators. This is a shared security model where the projects compete for slots during auctions.\n\n#### Reinventing Staking\n\nParachains that want to take advantage of the \"wisdom of the crowd\" and assign tasks to the community need to reinvent staking. At Robonomics, that's what we did. The staking architecture in the Robonomics parachain is unique and specific to the blockchain issues that we solve for the IoT market. We offer two ways to pay for the basic functionality of smart devices: per transaction or by monthly subscription.\n\nPer-transaction payment is self-explanatory. The subscription function needs a little explanation. Some IoT use cases need to periodically access cloud functions, and it is highly undesirable for these to fail. The gas-price mechanism still does not fully solve this problem, especially when it comes to guaranteeing transactions on every block. With this in mind, we came up with the idea of using the staking mechanism to manage a guaranteed quota with a subscription model. On the Substrate side, we did a little trick, based on zero-weight transaction priority processing. If an IoT device activates a subscription, then all its transactions will have priority over any others, except of course other zero-weight transactions. As more tokens go into the network's staking pool, more subscriptions will become available to users. \n\n<Card>\n\n*For example:*\n\nTotal tokens: 2,000,000 XRT;\nstaked: 800,000 XRT;\nparachain bandwidth: 5400 tx per block. \n\nThis gives us 5400 * 800,000 / 2,000,000 = 2,160 monthly subscriptions for IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\nI will write about how the subscriptions and the payment pool will be distributed in a separate article entitled “Automated Subscription Auction.”\n\n### Practical Use\n\nDApp ready to go: https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/staking/\n\n![XRT staking in Robonomics dapp, new bonding screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image2.jpg)\n\nAfter the first transaction, you will get a table of statistics like this:\n\n![XRT staking in Robonomics dapp, bonding list screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image4.jpg)\n\nSending tokens between accounts on the parachain will remain disabled. The ability to transfer tokens will be enabled after the parachain goes live on the Kusama network. \n\n### Observations\n\nAs of [block # 235,047](https://robonomics.subscan.io/block/235047), we have approximately one thousand accounts; the largest token holder is the treasury. Treasury funds will not participate in staking.\n\nThe remaining accounts on the network appeared as a result of using the Exodus DApp by ERC-20 token holders, or they were participants in the first crowd loan campaign in the Kusama auctions.\n\nThanks to the integration with Subscan, XRT holders on the Robonomics parachain can use this wonderful interface: https://robonomics.subscan.io/account\n\n![Robonomics Subscan.io account screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image3.jpg)\n\nOn the Exodus DApp interface, you can see the migration statistics from the Ethereum blockchain to the Robonomics parachain: https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/exodus\n\n![XRT from the Ethereum blockchain to the Robonomics parachain in Robonomics dapp](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image6.jpg)\n\n### Further Improvements to Staking Functionality\n\nThe current task for the developers is to test the basic staking mechanisms for token holders under real conditions: adding to the staking pool, accumulating rewards, and unfreezing tokens within 7 days. \n\n*An interesting task for the community:* check the correctness of the reward calculator, taking into account the two options: a 10% annual reward for participants in the Exodus migration and a 50% annual reward for members of the crowd loan campaign.\n\nAfter the 1.3 RWS update, the staking mechanism will go live on the network. The RWS update will add subscription capability for digital twins, and the challenge of bandwidth allocation will make sense. Accordingly, we will later be able to fully assess the correctness of the staking mechanism.\n\n## Update 1.2: Tech Committee and Treasury\n\nAs with update 1.1, this has already been implemented into the parachain work. The technical committee is currently made up of six technical specialists who have taken part in the development of the parachain during the last 2 years; the DAO [transferred 692,500 XRT](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6b9a9cbe7d21badf565ebce0fb50b865da8f5f784899db5fb455d1b276d14acf) to the balance of the treasury of the parachain by burning ERC-20 tokens through the Exodus DApp. The network's treasury and technical committee are the first elements of on-chain governance that the parachain developers have implemented so far. More details about each of them are given below.\n\n### Network Technical Committee\n\nThe technical committee portal is available at: https://parachain.robonomics.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmain.frontier.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/techcomm\n\n![The technical committee portal in Robonomics parachain](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image5.jpg)\n\nAs of September 15, you can see the six members of the technical committee that were added: 2 devops specialists, a software architect, the main Substrate implementation developer, a senior robotics engineer, and a senior DApp developer.\nThe technical committee will take care of updating the parachain runtime code, starting with subsequent releases on GitHub.\n\nYou can read more about the work of this committee in the Polkadot wiki: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee\n\nUntil the Robonomics parachain goes live on Kusama, the project developers will not expand on-chain governance by adding councils or referenda. After the successful launch of the parachain, we will revisit the question of new opportunities to influence network operations for new project participants.\n\n### Treasury\n\nThe parachain treasury is available here: https://parachain.robonomics.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmain.frontier.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/treasury\n\n![The treasury in Robonomics parachain](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image1.jpg)\n\nOver the past month, ~100k XRT was distributed from the treasury to the balances of participants in the first Robonomics crowd loan campaign from Summer 2021. These operations are not shown as requests, but rather done by Sudo. Now that we have a technical committee, requests will go through a vote. \n\nIt is also worth noting an interesting mechanism of the treasury: the periodic burning of balances. You can read more about the work of the treasury in the Polkadot wiki: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-treasury\n\nThe community can request that the parachain treasury allocate XRT for tasks that will be useful in the development of Robonomics in the Polkadot ecosystem or for attracting users from the IoT market.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere are many exciting updates to come, and each will open up new opportunities for the community. Updates to the project's community development program will soon be published with more information on what will be available to the community over the next 6 months.\n\n<Card
