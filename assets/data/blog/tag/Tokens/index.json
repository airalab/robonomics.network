Before the next wave of auctions, the project’s developers decided to deploy and maintain a functionally identical network.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Not a wild cousin of Kusama\n\nKusama Relay chain is under development and passes all updates using stable versions of Polkadot releases. For example, the current version of Kusama was built on [polkadot v0.9.8](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.8) release.\n\n![Kusama Relay Chain and Polkadot release 0.9.8](./images/Robonomics-Frontier/Kusama-Relay-Chain-and-Polkadot-release-0-9-8.jpg)\n\nFrontier Relay chain will use the same versions of Polkadot releases, which will be implemented by Kusama network in the form of its Relay chain.\n\nTo connect to Frontier Relay chain, you can use Substrate portal following this link: https://parachain.robonomics.network/ \n\nAfter connecting the Robonomics parachain to the Frontier Relay chain we can have a blockchain that could work in real-time and would be integrated into the Kusama network. It means that we need to overcome any challenges that Kusama parachains will have. All new capabilities that will appear with new Polkadot releases, will be also supported by Robonomics’ parachain.\n\n## XCMP and integration with Kusama parachains\n\nMaybe only one disadvantage today (in 2021), when we are talking about the lifecycle in a Frontier network and not about the main Kusama network, is a lack of integration via [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain#overview-of-xcmp).\n\nBut it does not mean that you cannot execute technical integration tasks and prepare a Robonomics parachain to work with Karura, Moonriver and Khala. It is those three parachains that are interesting for the Robonomics team in terms of integration. We can start maintaining work in a Frontier network with copies of the mentioned projects, but only after release of public documentation and first samples of using Kusama (how to create trading pair on Karura, connect functions of parachain with solidity/ink smart contracts in Moonriver, or to provide data privacy with Khala).\n\nI’m personally expecting that the process of parachains integration would be executed very carefully in the first year, and maybe other projects will also work together in sandboxes and after it transfer integration mechanisms to Kusama network. So, Robonomics could be in the Kusama network right to the moment of active integration between the projects.\n\n## Genesis block of Robonomics parachain in Frontier network\n\nIn the genesis block will be presented XRT balances of exodus participants, crowdloan contributors and open test network collators. This block will be formed only a few days before the parachain launch in a Frontier network. We will announce this update on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) and [Telegram](https://t.me/Robonomics_ann).\n\nWe are expecting that the genesis block will be formed during the period from 28th to 31st of July.\n\nImportant information for XRT holders in the Ethereum network: To participate in the parachain’s genesis block and participate in staking, you can use dapp exodus till 28th of July. After 28th of July the opportunity to transfer XRT tokens into Ethereum to Frontier will still be available. But this process will be executed by the technical committee of the network and not more often than once a week.\n\nAlso we would like to notice, that the exodus would not allow you to go back till the moment when Robonomics parachain will be connected to the Kusama network, and when there will be suitable bridge to Ethereum. The situation is ~ similar to the process of transfer to Ethereum 2.0 for ETH holders.\n\n## XRT staking\n\nXRT staking in Robonomics parachain aims to split the capacity between two options of payments: for transaction or for subscription. You can read more about this in the article [“RWS overview, part 2 “Heterogeneous tokenomics”](https://blog.aira.life/rws-overview-part-2-heterogeneous-tokenomics-afc209cc855) on Medium.\n\nThe basis of reward for the staking will be ~ 10%. This amount helps to launch the parachain. In the future, the reward will be determined by [Democracy pallet](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/pallet_democracy/) for XRT holders. \n\nCrowdloan contributors will get increased reward rate — 50%. Thus, it will help us to test the mechanism: “Parachain, which always wins”, which will propose adaptive reward for staking Robonomics to the reward for staking in Kusama / Polkadot relay chain and considering XRT price to KSM/DOT. We will explain later in detail about this mechanism and after a few tests. \n\nStaking will be available from the update 1.1 in Frontier network. Please note that tokens transfer in parachain will be turned off on the start, similar to the launch of the Polkadot Relay chain.\n\n## Roadmap - Life after auction\n\nRegardless of that we did not win a slot — the roadmap of parachain development won’t change. Below you will find our plans that were published in the article: https://robonomics.network/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/.\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 1: Establishing core functionality\n\nIn 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n* **Genesis state: (0 week)** Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.\n* **Update 1.1** Staking and allowing transfers (3 - 4 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for all token holders and 50% for Crowdloan participants.\n* **Update 1.2** Treasury and Technical committee (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n* **Update 1.3** RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n* **Update 1.4** Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n* **Update 1.5** XCMP functionality and Robobank (11 - 12 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n* **Update 1.6** Democracy and Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D\n\n2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.\n\n* **Globally available digital passports of products** By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.\n* **Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics** We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries. The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n* **Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits** It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n* **Fault-tolerant civil sensors network** A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.\n* **Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas** It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n* **Ecosystem integration updates** We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain. This is our vision of the future of Robonomics, as a complete segment of the Polkadot infrastructure specifically prepared for working with IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\" imageSize=\"big\">\n\nEnsRationis\n\nRobonomics network architect\n\nelement: @ensrationis:robonomics.network\n\n</Card>\n\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.62c183a.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.9ea8d39.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 480w","/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.6b2ed88.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.62c183a.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-a8d4627542763c17c6fd0d78e16693ac'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-a8d4627542763c17c6fd0d78e16693ac)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAYDBwECBQj/xAAvEAACAQMDAwMBBwUAAAAAAAABAgMEBREAEiEGE0ExUWGBByIjQnGRoRUkMsHw/8QAGQEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwYBBAUC/8QAJhEAAQQCAQMDBQAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxEEEkEFEzEhIlFxgZGSwf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A82RIrKSx/bxqSWBVQlc5X/LPg88enrrFNHLP%2bFHHvxz642/XUtZBLAx3QhFc8ENuH6aYgCTSN236716fPCgp6aWqlMcChmwW5IAwPk6Dk4JzwdWX9i9ugq%2bpgZiso7Tq8fbJ7Y4w5YkAc4AAyT7D10v9cpYBfLpT2qCohminaOLsuJIZcHBwDhl88AtoWQ6hSr7%2b4tpcbpy3R1lS0tQ0Zp4MF0YnLZ/18661bQ2ePYkSQn8I5IZ8glvOfzDPjjGgLH/ZVi0zx1sNzaoVNuAm1fI%2b9yG588aZUjtUsMvbqqxWIMciO8WcbuVPx5/XXcUUboC8AEjyqczX9zYuoLW5dNW6uo6v%2blNRJJG3dWaJpO2yheQN/IXzyM5%2bNV6NP8Vc6Uz0dsNxqqeeYxOg2OXbbxgLySAT8aRZYJYJninjeKVCVZHGGUjwR76rnR7g1go0oxu40uEjrHCerNDTQuQ8YcZBK5xu%2bM6l6laKpSRlhihDYCRxjAUD/vXQIONRTnIydbRYQ7e0/l7BAYtR4I/KaOiesem7NRGhulknpZ3jMTXSgmJm5YMGKMcZBAIx%2b3J1r18nSqTVfUXR/VES1U8iym2vSMG35BJUlcLzlsH09/TVfV3roFE7kyJnG5gP50vZfT6l7kcjhZsiwQf2BI%2bxFcUleSo3GgmGyWG7dYXBqmpnmcSud1TNlzI/sPckkfvqwIPszjt9JIezcWLRhXflRk87hx7Zxrj01eaBUjpY1ijiwFVSR6effPn66xcur6zshArBQRx3nwR7Yzpuw%2bihlegJ5ShPPk5UlMdq3gD%2brWltlV0Rfaa7WpDHOpMcUNfFvjnJADLu4xwQefcc6Teo7hWXi/V9fdF21s8paZcYw3pjH00VdbtPcmUzl/ukkAyMw/kn20NcSJqalnKgScxMR%2bfbggn5wcfQaLL0THgeMljad4P0WnFs2g82flf/2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Crowdloan unveils plan B to win with plan A","path":"/blog/kusama-crowdloan-guaranteed-rewards/","date":"July 2, 2021","description":"Risk-free contribution in Robonomics Crowdloan announcement.

For four years, in parallel with the Parity developers, we studied the future network architecture, tried early developments of the Substrate framework and prepared the Robonomics parachain for launch with one goal - to create a vertical in the Polkadot ecosystem that will be machine-friendly.\n\nRobonomics team consists of robotics engineers, academic researchers, and software developers. We are one of the few who have been studying the possibilities of Bitcoin, Ethereum, IPFS and Polkadot for communication between people and automated services connected to the Internet for seven years. We want to see smart cities of the future today, but we don't wish these cities of the future to be smart concentration camps for people watching you and can get access to your house, car, or pacemaker without your permission. \n\nI am sure that the only alternative for total control is the p2p economically significant interaction, so the IoT platform we are developing is called Robonomics.\n\nBy winning a parachain slot in the Kusama network, we will open the doors for hundreds of IoT developers to the Polkadot ecosystem and help them take their first steps under the guidance of experienced teachers and roboticists. Most IoT developers we interviewed are happy to try an alternative to the usual corporate clouds, but it simply does not exist today. Almost every engineer we know understands the problems associated with client-server solutions. However, today there is still no environment that a corporation does not manage and at the same time produces user’s trust.\n\nPolkadot is a trust-free ecosystem, and Robonomics is a way to connect smart devices under its control. Contribute to its development. We offer up to 5 XRT per 1 KSM to early supporters who bonds the first 35,000 KSM. The proposed reward makes Robonomics Crowdloan more profitable than stacking in Kusama Relay Chain at the current rate by more than two times.\n\nWe’ll announce the launch of the Robonomics Crowdloan campaign on [the Robonomics Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) account in the coming hours.\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Read the terms of participating in the Robonomics crowdloan campaign in the blog:\n\n[https://robonomics.network/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/](/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Participate in the crowdloan through the dedicated page:\n\n[https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot](/kusama-slot)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### You can also always use the standard interfaces from parity:\n\n[https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\" imageSize=\"big\">\n\n### Welcome to our journey!\n\nEnsRationis\n\nRobonomics network architect\n\nelement: @ensrationis:robonomics.network\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.62c183a.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.9ea8d39.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg 480w","/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.6b2ed88.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.62c183a.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-822c560b1b2911897138f1c4e3d4588c'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-822c560b1b2911897138f1c4e3d4588c)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bjdmieJcY4vIpPyAsFfTKGbrCu74cyOq0hTtEbX2QEKBXb4I3xoj%2bDctxxRk1FDbajcFhhS7fFjb43w5ZmkUqiswqjXZCxIjp/G0kjW8tIvYDuR92%2bcN816LIiw5DtTkRQ7HQ4mOHencFB3uPu/2kYhOmcuwi5R8TY1Nlc1SsqToco13HpvEge8G5Ta0Ki1FLoSQVCRHUj/AFte/wB45pmUU051xmQaY4tDQU4W4rznRSeFrKU2Twefu2LVRmYxlmS1VJjhAc/TLkFxFrD97WuPa5xPIdXFXqa52WHQtl5r9QXgv0OqKWknpgXNkoJ3sLEm%2bGkzOZrF6Vj2KLczJjpA1YAPsCWLPdrawqycnRaeCZNQy8Soa0tqWoqIIuNI5N%2b2EWLlee9OW/MqUSJS2wCgtNuPF0kketQTpTba4B7jc4Za5m2gQqgVRKfLnwIqURVykSVtB3QkIJSE2uLC19wcUzLNNyxV6XAqVBpcSXAkC6HFpKygg7pIUTYg3vgvQ7GDL4lmSJYUuatRt/PLFxdjckdiA%2b4gp/MVTjeFjtUP46m2rQVoRrF9QGq3192wvzcyT2W489yZ5gN3BbShKgq/cHm4IFvs4WH6tOj1x2AmW/8Aw9toyBG1%2bjWEagbfYvjrjIU29ESlw6g0Ooq39QK3sRxtbb2/9VPSVUoeMEq6s4Pm2tulvW8c6mVKFoSCSCw7eo%2b9oy6qZmaiPuVRtLb8tZLesW6beoaQB7gX/fFRertFp%2biDPeS3IZhlaGUunWplHfTcf48/B9jhBUTcWt6bkbY1Vqd52VHEiNGU88lcVT/T/IGlIOpIV2BxTxijrZ02RMpFDIkHM%2b7s1vfRo0aLEkKzy1hgpTpSNATY/AF30ii0ip06XCam0tDihIbJCnH1LsDsbeog8cjEqy7FXRoUhEeI01OacUkrK7B5B3BUeR6VEDnjjBCgTXqMXKZD0%2bVist9HqDUpIJVcE9998FKfl2PXI8iQ5IksOxSFt9JQtfcm9xzt77YFh8qpoZlRUVy/CJ/RtgM2o7d/iJVlWZmWlpg51UCWBZiPvnHnRjLVWjU9%2bLIulMtd4%2blCnA/vYWWBpPvyLYsnhfVallXJMKkClNPOBDrrakv3GorJ9Xxa3HJB39gvibJLDUOmR20NQ0krShN9tOwH/ScMuQcvJmZDcr70t/zDAUy00LaAlBAsffb6tg%2bGVgq6ZNTPTa%2bUbm9ul%2b5aHxIugS6dDKd1F/LVi/sI/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Crowdloan final parameters and 48 weeks roadmap","path":"/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/","date":"June 28, 2021","description":"Robonomics Developers publish the KSM crowdloan module on June 28th. Meet final parameters, increased rewards, Robonomics development plans after auction.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Robonomics Crowdloan final parameters\n\nRobonomics Developers will publish the KSM crowdloan module on June 28th with the following parameters:\n\n* **Crowdloan limit - 135,000 KSM. It’ll allow competing for the 3rd slot.** At the moment, PLO auction participants bid around 25,000 - 30,000 KSM for the 5th slot\n* **For each KSM bonded, you’ll get 3.5 XRT on the horizon of 48 weeks.** Based on the current XRT and KSM price, Robonomics crowdloan offer outperforms Kusama Relay Chain staking by x1.5\n* **1.725 XRT will be unlocked within the first month** after the Robonomics parachain launch\n* **KSM bonders will get the entire reward in one year of XRT staking** with an increased APR of up to 100%\n* **Distribution of the crowdloan rewards will happen in Robonomics parachain. There won’t be an option to get rewards in ERC-20 XRT**\n\n## Bonuses\n\n* **Robonomics crowdloan won’t provide any referral bonuses**\n* **Increased reward for the first 35,000 KSM collected.** Get 5 XRT instead of 3,5 in one year\n* **Extra reward for [Robonomics Polkapet NFT](https://opensea.io/assets/0x8cb813bf27dc744fc5fb6ba7515504de45d39e08/24) holders, who’ll bond the first 35,000 KSM.** Get 6 XRT instead of 3,5 XRT in one year.\n\n## Most important to know\n\nRobonomics developers are early adopters of Polkadot. We understand that the current technical implementation of the Kusama Relay Chain and Substrate framework may contain errors and be reviewed this or next year. The participants of the crowdloan campaign need to keep that in mind.\n\nBesides, the entire Polkadot ecosystem is establishing now, this process may take an indefinite time. Don’t forget this whenever studying any plans of developers.\n\nThis is a grand experiment, ladies and gentlemen.\nYou want to participate in it at your own risk.\n\nWelcome to our journey!\n\n## Roadmap - Life after auction\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Part 1: Establishing core functionality\n\nIn 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n* Genesis state: (0 week). Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.\n* Update 1.1: Staking and allowing transfers (3 - 4 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for token holders and 100% for Crowdloan participants.\n* Update 1.2: Treasury and Technical committee (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n* Update 1.3: RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n* Update 1.4: Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n* Update 1.5: XCMP functionality and Robobank (11 - 12 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n* Update 1.6: Democracy and Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D\n\n2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.\n\n* Globally available digital passports of products. By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.\n* Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics. We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries.  The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n* Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits. It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n* Fault-tolerant civil sensors network. A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.\n* Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas. It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n* Ecosystem integration updates. We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain. This is our vision of the future of Robonomics, as a complete segment of the Polkadot infrastructure specifically prepared for working with IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\n## How to participate in the crowdloan?\n\nWe’ll announce the launch of the Robonomics Crowdloan campaign on the [Robonomics Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) account in the coming hours.\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Participate in the crowdloan through the dedicated page:\n\n[https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot](https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### You can also always use the standard interfaces from parity:\n\n[https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan)\n\n</Card>\n\nWelcome to our journey!","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/Crowdloan_final_parameters_Roadmap_blog.62c183a.1334954a880a6bdc5c4cbc0833f10276.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/Crowdloan_final_parameters_Roadmap_blog.9ea8d39.1334954a880a6bdc5c4cbc0833f10276.jpg 480w","/assets/static/Crowdloan_final_parameters_Roadmap_blog.6b2ed88.1334954a880a6bdc5c4cbc0833f10276.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/Crowdloan_final_parameters_Roadmap_blog.62c183a.1334954a880a6bdc5c4cbc0833f10276.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-b69028c1d18c9ea15b7bd19401a45446'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-b69028c1d18c9ea15b7bd19401a45446)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQYHAwIE/8QALRAAAgEDBAECBQMFAAAAAAAAAQIDBAURAAYSITFBURMUYXGBBxWRImKhwfH/xAAZAQADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBAYFAwf/xAAqEQABAwMDBAEDBQAAAAAAAAABAgMRBAUhABIxBiJBUVIUYYFxkbHB8P/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8ARYQjTRJJIsSOwUu3hR76JLb6I8c3ikXPnKnrVNscVui2vbWnokaWSnB%2bItIJDnsZPXn766p46P5lnaFJIEbBRrWFPecYbAz/ABpBXWbDKlNqpySkkTu5gx61W3LqJ81Kw04pABiAEkYx5E551LZKKjVQUulO59QFxx8%2b57/Ghlc8VLWyU0k6h0YjiiM7keh4jxn66pH6himSitlTbqWKFviyY5QCPJUDGRgdZ1HtqXdjX1CvKFV05SFwOcrk5LFifJJPXtqgttxF2aQpprZvJHMnBj7aWqeoqyiYRUpdLhUCdpAAGYyUifB9aJpWUrVJp1qlFQG4mKZDG2fYZ6J%2bmjsduo2bD3amjODnkh6Iz159f%2b6n%2b75VqK0/A5MjytxVwvMePIHQP21T/wBLLPFd7vaKW%2bZmjnozK%2bHKnpTjJB89DR1Vwp7e0446NwSCr7wBJHr%2bNMW6%2bV11JK3S1tSVHaAQYj5ZnPv9tC0t9M8hDXWmjXOAxyQRgd9fn%2bNDiuHYBsgHAIPR%2burPNsu2iWcU1gpJY42YBzeGA456Le2f8fXWVz2dY49rXWraghpq%2bCF5Ikir2nxgeT%2bdTY69tjxDSGVAqIAPaYk%2bt2tGgue2oSXKhawcQUJAM45BnBzqPSXy7Us0UFPW1aQBBwRDIxduQHEEHigAJYlvbAB04bZea5X%2b3Uc93uqxSA/MGScx4YAnipyfOPXvSxbeRuVIqsV5TIpx6gsMjTpvC2U9Nt%2bSpo40p5GkjeQpn%2bvLAYOT/cdbdRRJdQtKYBUDmBifP96K9VX0VehucLzwMSNvqTB7taXPbUNfUVIO4Jp7XSArPNMxcxuQQVGeuhg8h64HepjU7FnszisuDzmj%2bIFWqgXmmPQ5/wBeDqj2JxapBHEoeJlaOVG8Sqw4sD9wfx1pLLusLQfEf4OclOR4kj1I8Z0%2bi2qoW20KVJA54M/iB/vzqCR1SzdKpStu5pBgAgZBHOIgkyeSB5B1jU7ZbcFRVVG3YqwQK2PmpkCgDHjPhfcgZP11R9i2Kl2fU2253CuSS1CBopHKNnk6kAgDPJCQwBGp4GZYXjVmWNu2QEgH8adrvVveZC9SoVHREVF8RqoAVV9gBoXbULm06wowFJIJ851zqupmLa%2blSEFLa%2b1QSAO3zzMngiNo8Rp%2bfeO3SZl/c7aIZPCmjlJK5yA2V714b7u2wVO27xF%2b4UU1dNA8cJgpZEJBXHEkj3%2b2ou2FPD3JxjA9M58ZPgeuudRLPQlCy4lwOLlJB5T4z8dep0/TlKFBwKVIIPj9fWv/2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Crowdloan and further steps, June 2021","path":"/blog/kusama-crowdloan-details/","date":"June 11, 2021","description":"Take a look at the Cowdloan module in details, parachain update plan after launching, and FAQ regarding auction","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\nDuring the summer of 2021, we’ll see the first five auctions that will allow projects to rent Kusama network slots for a period of 48 weeks (or 1 year). Becoming one of Kusama's parachains is a good way to provide access to your Substrate project within the Polkadot ecosystem, implement currently unavailable Blockchain network security to small projects, as well as initiate the integration process with other ecosystem projects as soon as possible. The goal of Robonomics for 2022 is to become a fully functioning conductor of IoT projects to the Polkadot ecosystem. This is why all of the aforementioned benefits of launching a Kusama network are important to us. And in general, our strategy has [already been published](/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/) a long time ago - \"Kusama first, while Polkadot is a vision\". In this post, we’ll dissect the use of the Cowdloan module in detail and take a look at the parachain update plan after launching. \n\n## Kusama crowdloans have started!\n\n*Dr. Gavin Wood, June 8, 2021, [Kusama Parachain Auctions](https://polkadot.network/kusama-parachain-auctions/):*\n\n> The following is the case assuming that no significant and unexpected issues are found with the relay-chain logic. (In such a case, all options should remain on the table for network governance, including pausing or postponing any scheduled or ongoing auctions.)\n\n**Preliminary schedule of auctions:**\n\n- 2021/06/15, 12:00 GMT: First Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences. Bids may be placed.\n\n- 2021/06/22, 12:00 GMT: Second Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/06/29, 12:00 GMT: Third Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/07/06, 12:00 GMT: Fourth Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/07/13, 12:00 GMT: Fifth Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\nPolkadot allows parachains to source tokens for their parachain bids in a decentralized [crowdloan](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crowdloans). Once a crowdloan campaign is open, anyone can participate by sending a special transaction that references the campaign's index. Tokens used to participate must be transferable — that is, not locked for any reason, including staking, vesting, and governance — because they will be moved into a module-controlled account that was generated uniquely for this campaign.\n\nFour projects who launched their KSM crowdloan campaigns (Kurara up to 1,5 mln KSM, Shiden up to 1 mln KSM, Crust up to 1 mln KSM, Moonriver up to 1 mln KSM)  to collect resources for leasing the parachain slot on Kusama during the parachain lease offering auctions. \n\nRobonomics Dev DAO aims to bid an exact amount of KSM needed for securing a third-fifth parachain slot. Thus, the crowdloan module will be launched right after the end of the auction for 2nd slot on Kusama.\n\n## Estimated time of the Robonomics crowdloan launch is 28 June\n\nYou’ll be able to participate in the Robonomics crowdloan through the [dedicated page](/kusama-slot).\n\n**Before participating in the crowdloan, double-check that the campaign is live [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).**\n\n## How to participate in the Robonomics Crowdloan \n\nBy default, Polkadot developers provided a native interface in the [Substrate portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan)\n\n![Crowdloan on Polkadot portal](./images/kusama-crowdloan-details/crowdloan-on-polkadot-portal.png)\n*Example of the Crowdloan page on June 11th, 2021*\n\nAt the start of April, Robonomics practised participating in auctions by using the Crowdloan module on the Rococo network. You can check out this Twitter thread to familiarize yourself with the standard interface for community participation in [Polkadot auctions](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1377653645827833860)\n\nAlso, it’s worth mentioning that on the official [Robonomics site](/kusama-slot), functionality for interacting with the Crowdloan module will be made available.\n\n![How to participate in Robonomics Crowdloan on Kusama](./images/kusama-crowdloan-details/crowdloan2.gif)\nThis is what Crowdloan participation will look like on the Robonomics site after June 28th. \n\nInstructions on how to use the Crowdloan interface module through the Robonomics website will be published closer to the start of the third auction. \n\n## Popular questions amongst the community\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Why does Robonomics participation start only from the third round?\n\nDevelopers could publish the Crowdloan module today, but then we would have to implement limits. As can be noticed, the first 4 projects that published their Crowdloan modules established a 1 million KSM token limit. \n\nWe’re placing our bets on 100,000 KSM being enough to win one of the Kusama network auctions, but are also reserving space for ourselves to quickly adjust the limit if we come to understand that more KSM tokens will need to be collected by the conclusion of the first and second rounds. In general, we’re trying to manoeuvre in search of an optimal rental cost for a slot.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### What will happen if Robonomics doesn’t win the 5th auction? \n\nTo be honest, we don’t have a plan B. [We'll be like Schwarzenegger](https://youtu.be/Ri-M_Vo3w5A).\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Will it be possible to participate in the Robonomics crowdloan through exchanges? \n\nSome well-known exchanges like Kraken and Okex are already providing crowdloan support for their users. A list of relevant exchanges that support interaction with the Crowdloan module will be provided on the Robonomics website at the start of the 3rd auction.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### What will happen in 48?\n\nIf after 48 weeks the project will once again be unsuccessful in winning an auction, then the parachain will turn into a [parathread](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parathreads#docsNav). However, developers have already published preparation plans for future slot auctions: here’s a publication from October 26th, 2020, [Robonomics Parachain Lease Offering, On-chain Governance Strategy](/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/). But, we also have a secret plan concerning the development of an algorithm to be built into the Robonomics protocol, which will autonomously generate beneficial bonding terms for KSM/DOT holders that will also benefit Robonomics. In general, we contemplate over medium-term issues in advance and continue to think about important matters such as maintaining Robobomics in the state of a parachain today.\n\n</Card>\n\n## Life after auctions\n\nA parachain comes to life inseparably from the moment auction results are concluded. But for a project, this doesn’t indicate that work is over. Remember how the Polkadot Relay Chain launched? The Robonomics team is contemplating over an analogous launch form, increasing functionality accessible to a user in steps. \n\n## Robonomics will start its existence with the following possibilities: \n\n- XRT transfers between balances\n\n- Launch of IoT devices using XRT for paying transaction fees \n\n- Sending IoT device telemetry using XRT for paying transaction fees \n\n- Sudo\n\n- A technical committee\n\n## Further update plan\n\n- Genesis state: Core functionality (0 week). Launch of the above set of functions.\n\n- Update 0.1: Staking (1 - 3 week). Will allow you to stake your XRT with a 10% APY for token holders and 125% for Crowdloan participants. \n\n- Update 0.2: Treasury (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. \n\n- Update 0.3: RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments but a monthly subscription as well. \n\n- Update 0.4: Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices. \n\n- Update 0.5: Robobank (11 - 12 week).

For example, it allows Polkadot users to [pay vending machines or robots in any token of the Polkadot ecosystem](https://robonomics.network/blog/robobank-introduction/).\n\nRobonomics is a project with a long history that started in 2015, after the launch of the Ethereum network. During the project’s development, the team published more than [10 academic articles](https://robonomics.network/community#science) and created more than [15 R&D projects](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/r-and-d-based-on-robonomics-network/) which included control of drones, industrial manipulators, sensor networks, and even a Boston Dynamics’ robot dog over Ethereum and Polkadot networks.\n\nRobonomics is a project that integrates new technologies into the real economy. However, to fuel this, a reasonable ‘gas’ price is required. Kusama makes the costs of communication between IoT devices and humans affordable.\n\nKusama Auction mechanics: [https://kusama.network/auctions](https://kusama.network/auctions)\n\nParachain Crowdloans: [https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/mirror-learn-crowdloans](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/mirror-learn-crowdloans)\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n![\"Robomomics Parachain on Kusama wallpaper\"](./images/Kusama-Parachain-auction/wallpaper_KUSAMA_6.jpg)\n\n</section>\n\n**Community, support our auction** 🦾\n\nRobonomics Developers DAO\n\nStay tuned: [https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics)\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.62c183a.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":676},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.9ea8d39.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 480w","/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.6b2ed88.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.62c183a.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 676' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-147d193177a363b1cc489fc0649b0a75'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-147d193177a363b1cc489fc0649b0a75)' width='1500' height='676' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2blXIqGSLODIpBIIBwDzxnU9v%2bwUG7tlXG03cyJTVCeuEZdGVgylQRyfMBx79tVv4U%2bHdr2BUXu81F3rL/dGolibqU3TEcDYYIFyc5wMnOAB7c6EuFcNdyi7oaS7mytu4Xqmoyg/KUuvnHTwR5fnOnUVUlRRJUU5yj4IJH38a4%2bzu252kkiFPTLTBYWkpX6kZ49I4HK/XsRrr6aBLfQJDDysYxlvfJ5Op0vrhORGxwMsdP73rfhNflZTS3qunJYBgpzk9uNCrEyup7DGONJgvUQscMM4Ge%2bkrkyuuB%2bONU0hZZgJEXHJzz8aYXusNrtdbXqvUMUfnCE4Bx96kCASCRyO2hqIY6iF4p0WSJxhlYZBH3rWEBwLhssNabKrJPFGsUqBZEKN/t1Wxj54XTGo8U5Up2hFko2ixjpiR8EfGOnjVnNtuyt6rXRH%2bYRrW21LA3qs1vP8wL%2btVNRIHwvX7SGsjDlypHbfif8A43b5aW32SIRSztMRJUyElm74xH2OMj6OlW/1CXGm6hbaatEneT%2b7YKR88pq6js7bZ72K2H/mT9aBtkbXYYbb1qI%2b6VP1o2zXZ45gnzPyjwxLlbNlXltzbWtF7eEU7VkAmMKt5gufbPGdTSsDI64wRjn50FFSU9DSRUtFDHBTRL5Y4o1Cqo%2bAB2GtoABJA5PfUmIWlxLRQWTAv//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Robobank.

Each parachain that adds a Robobank branch to its runtime will be able to use the functions of launching a smart device running under the Robonomics parachain control.\n\n\nUsers will not have to pay commissions outside of the native parachain token  — any payment made through Robobank will provide a free execution of an automated service / launch of an IoT device for the user. The only thing that the owner of the automated service will need is an active subscription of the IoT device to use the Robonomics parachain.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## Polkadot for IoT.

This approach saves us from the fear of being in a cool but empty sandbox.\n\nThe presence of the Robonomics parachain will allow other Polkadot parachains to expand the functionality of native tokens by adding instead of the full and rather complex functionality of working with IoT devices to your virtual machine (i.e runtime), functions such as: pay for launching an IoT device or receive data from the device during the payment process.\n\nNext, we will look at an example of architecture using multiple Polkadot parachains in order to extend the capabilities of any project through infrastructure integration solutions based on XCMP.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## Robobank Architecture\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n![\"Robobank from Robonomics introduction, infographics\"](./images/robobank-introduction/robobank-introduction-infographics.png)\n\n</section>\n\nConsider an example of a truly decentralized Uber service.\n\nBy implementing Uber Parachain, developers could focus on the rating system of drivers, the system for processing user requests in p2p mode, and other customer service issues, and not worry about the need to simultaneously support the IoT component of their applications — Robonomics will help with IoT. Uber Parachain will only need to integrate the Robobank pallet into its runtime in order to provide customer access to the car after payment and receive trip reports directly from the IoT modules of the car.\n\n### Let's have a look at the diagram above and highlight the important points:\n\n* **Polkadot token** is a native parachain token, implemented for example through the assets pallet.\n* **Robonomics Web Services** is a pallet inside the Robonomics parachain, which implements the ability to connect an IoT device under the control of the Polkadot network on a monthly subscription model with guaranteed bandwidth.\n* **IoT app** is a custom application for automating the ordering of services, in which the native parachain token is used for payment. In the example with Uber Parachain, it would be a familiar phone application for city residents to order a taxi or search for a carsharing service.\n* **The car icon** is an IoT device acting as a party to an automated service, partially or completely providing a service. In the example, it would be a car, and by no means a driver! It is the car that would be the party providing access to opening the car doors and generating a trip report with telemetry data.\n* **Robobank Branch** is the Robonomics module for inclusion in the Polkadot parachain network.\n* **Robobank Tower** is the Robonomics module that runs permanently in the runtime of the Robonomics parachain and can launch IoT devices with an active subscription based on token transfer transactions in neighboring parachains.\n\nAs you can see from the diagram and the description of the modules, the parachains need to install Robobank Branch, which can be performed in the parachain [update mode](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-protocol-info#runtime-upgrades) without a hard fork.\n\nNow let's look at a step-by-step use case to represent the full cycle of the Robobank module after the Robobank Branch is enabled by the Polkadot parachain.\n\n1. `PaymentToRobot()` — this function can be seen among others in the parachain after the Robobank Branch module is enabled. As a result of a user sending a transaction from an IoT application, Robobank Branch will receive data on the amount of the payment and the device that needs to be launched for execution.\n2. `TransferToRobobank()` – will ensure the transfer of funds from the user account to the Robobank account with the ability to withdraw the accumulated amount in one transaction from the IoT device. For example, after making 10 trips or working within 5 hours, the car can generate automatic transactions to transfer funds from the Robobank account to the address of the crypto exchange. There is no actual movement of tokens from one parachain to another.\n3. `SignalToRobonomics()` — will be a function using XCMP. It is important to note that we will be able to ensure that messages sent on behalf of Robobank Branch are identified and marked as trusted. Some analogue of communication between smart contracts in the Ethereum network.\n4. `SignalFromRobonomicsBranch()`  — the message sent in the previous step will be sent through the Relay chain for processing to the central node of the Robobank Tower module. Having received a message from the parachain, Robobank Tower will record the request to launch the payment device in the Robonomics parachain, and thereby remove the need to store the payment log on the side of each parachain who uses the Robobank Branch module. In fact, the Robobank branches will perform the functions of correspondent accounts and are subordinate to the main branch in the form of a Tower, in which the full history of the execution of the automated service with payment in the neighboring parachain will be kept.\n5. `FreeTXtoRWS()` — two modules of the Robonomics parachain can trust each other, just like smart contracts in Ethereum. If we can ensure trust in the request from Robobank Branch to Robobank Tower, then in the same way we can provide the ability to launch a device with an active subscription not from the device address, but based on payment in tokens.\n6. `Launch || Datalog` — a combination of these functions will allow, for example, to launch a service for execution with an indication of the user who will have access to the back door of the car in the Uber Parachain application, or record the data necessary for the provision of the service.\n7.

Decentralized infrastructure services over IPFS, Ethereum, and Polkadot for Robotics and IoT. For industrial, consumer, and commercial solutions","content":"\n**Robonomics Web Services (RWS)** is decentralized infrastructure services over IPFS, Ethereum, and Polkadot for Robotics and IoT. For industrial, consumer, and commercial solutions.\n\n## Meet the first RWS IoT Core services\nRWS is a state-of-the-art infrastructure that you will love. RWS lets connect devices easily and interact with user applications, cloud services, and other devices securely. No single point of failure, open-source, most interesting internet tech on a turn-key basis, and your freedom to use it in any place in the world. Truly global network for Robotics and IoT devices.\n\nThe first RWS IoT Core services over Robonomics Parachain:\n\n* **RWS: PubSub Message Broker.** Use unlimited messaging over a p2p network based on IPFS protocol.\n* **RWS: Data Blockchainization Service.** Put data into IPFS and store hashes in a public Blockchain.\n* **RWS: Robot Actions.** Switch on / off; launch or stop your IoT devices under control of decentralized computer.\n\n## Let’s begin subscription model experiment with RWS token\nThe main token of Robonomics network is XRT. This is utility token which your robotics / IoT devices can use to pay transactions fee to interact over Ethereum today. Soon, XRT will give your robotics systems the same opportunity in the Polkadot ecosystem with Robonomics Parachain.\n\nFor engineers, Core Dev team will try to make different Robonomics usage models and the first step in this way is launching lifetime subscription token — RWS token. As Tesla promoted their roadster with lifetime charging, so we want to promote Robonomics network with lifetime subscription offer for the first. Become a robot economy pioneers!\n\n> ### 1 RWS token will give you 1 transaction per second (tps) from/to your IoT device over Robonomics Parachain.\n>\n> Just activate your RWS token and make more than 2,500,000 tx in a month with no time limits. Deactivate RWS token and trade it on Uniswap any time you want.\n\n**Example case 1:** You own 0.1 RWS token and want to share telemetry with shadow in Public blockchain every 10 seconds. You need to activate it with transaction to special address of ethereum mainnet smart contract. After that, you can use RWS: Data Blockchainization Service each 10 seconds (1 RWS token == 1 tps, 0.1 RWS token == 1 tx / 10 sec).\n\n**Example case 2:** You own 2 RWS token and want to control automatic car wash under Robonomics control. You need to activate it with transaction to special address of ethereum mainnet smart contract. After that, you can use RWS: Data Blockchainization Service and RWS: Robot Actions each second in parallel mode.\n\n**Current status of RWS token:** initial distribution stage.\n\n**Total supply:** 100 RWS tokens which will present lifetime using of 100 tps Robonomics Parachain bandwidth.\n\n**Distribution plans:**\n* 50 RWS tokens will be distributed via [Uniswap XRT/RWS pair](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x42018a2ff89b6d662b5f746277bd02f0d85f485a).\n* 50 RWS tokens will be reserved for academia and non-profit organizations.\n\n**Expected time to launch RWS token functions:**\n* alpha version — Q3 2020\n* beta version — Q4 2020\n\n**Further emission of RWS.** Benchmarks of Polkadot Parachains indicate that 100 tps is a small part of potential bandwidth of Robonomics Parachain. At the same time, Core Dev team want to make different types of subscriptions. From our perspective, RWS token is pioneers’ especial offer. And in future, we will focus on other types of RWS tokens with monthly and other types of limitations of using Robonomics Web Services for Robotics and IoT devices.\n\n## Conclusion\nRobonomics Web Services is the new branch of evolution in Robonomics project. Earlier, we only said we have Software platform, Decentralized network Providers, and some use cases based on our technologies. From now on Robonomics project made step on the way to bring something at least as good as Amazon Web Services but on the top of new internet technologies wave. It still R&D and experimental, but pioneers who would like to be the first in new fields are welcome! More Services in RWS IoT Core and not only in core will be presented this summer. Alpha version will start as soon as possible.\n\nStay tuned and [follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/logo.62c183a.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/logo.9ea8d39.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg 480w","/assets/static/logo.6b2ed88.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg 1024w","/assets/static/logo.62c183a.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-f7bafff053f16303429b9f1d635e7c6b'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-f7bafff053f16303429b9f1d635e7c6b)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAwEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEBQMACP/EACkQAAIBBAICAQQBBQAAAAAAAAECAwAEESEFEhMxQRQiUWEVM3GBkaH/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/xAAaEQADAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARECITFB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwD6ppe%2bWYYOqalZlUFj8DJ1QE/HT3FxbeS7tfpZO7L4/IH%2b0MQGyPyMHHxmqJM%2bNuuM4OM1ksYuctLa9seQmitcF1aIFe%2bxs5wcaIwR81qLIsvkVc/bokjWxn/Pugk4GHPhTtjt1GcHI9UXZgpKr2P4zil7rGYozkltDA1of8rJ5GSy4rh7%2b%2b5e/mXj1zPJK7sPEo/BXeP1Qq96bK5xsYNGsfjo7SC6t/oluHjnh7rI0zuvU7GmJ/X73WxQ1vKy%2bHqBJBGBqjSyossTxvtWBU/2NDBFyjcir2X8alqytcKLnzsQViwclMe2zjR1R5ia7j4q7k4mGO4vljLQxM2A7Y0M0eP422sLG2tLZGENvuMO5cj38nZ9mqiAiMVUDXwKuXI2iaVTRPxs08vHW0t/D9NcugMkRYHo2NjIJH%2bjRaM3UdzDdxxNA2UADduykfII1XcAPGvcA6zsfqp77j7e8s7i2nQmGf8AqBWKk%2bvkbHoU%2bh2cKUAVQAMKBgCmrnDEkMEcSZCIoVcnJwPW66VAj//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"The ultimate guide to Robonomics, RWS and Robonomics parachain on Polkadot","path":"/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/","date":"February 25, 2021","description":"This article delves into the connection between Robonomics platform, its parachain on the Polkadot ecosystem and the Robonomics Web Services (RWS)","content":"\nTaking into account the never-ending discussions on the backbone operation of Robonomics, let’s investigate the under the hood structure and outline the main pillars of the network. This article delves into the connection between Robonomics platform, its [parachain](https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-parachain-on-kusama-40853780c709) on the Polkadot ecosystem and the [Robonomics Web Services](https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-web-services-and-rws-token-intro-d730ab50ad42) (RWS).\n\nThe Robonomics Network consists of multiple [repositories of code](https://github.com/airalab) that can be used separately in implementation of a fully-fledged IoT application. If you plan on connecting your smartphone for example to an IoT device, it is not enough to develop an app and link a bunch of sensors to it. Instead, you have to carry out a [chain of actions](https://blog.aira.life/simple-iot-scheme-990224363803) that will eventually lead to a connected IoT device and interconnected elements of the infrastructure, enabling the signal from the device to reach you.\n\n## The chronology of the Robonomics Network development\n\nSo how did the idea to create the [Robonomics parachain](https://parachain.robonomics.network/#/explorer) and [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/land/say-hello-to-robonomics/) came about? Originally, back in 2015–2017, we started with the development of a quite complicated solution we called the [Economy of Robots](https://blog.aira.life/the-first-in-the-economy-of-robots-6f4bb115643b). We are confident it is exactly what smart cities, industry 4.0 and the development of the IoT apps will come to.\n\nOur primary goal was to create software for cyber-physical systems that can manage autonomous and independent devices within the technical and economic transactions framework. Therefore, we decided to generate a technical and economy biased transaction and make it serve as a foundation for the development of more complicated processes.\n\nOne of my favourite scenarios of the Economy of Robots is called [Smart Building Offsetting](https://new.dapp.ipci.io/#/offsetting). It is a service that allows an autonomous building to collect and aggregate information on its energy consumption and then communicate it to another agent within the Robonomics Network, and even request carbon footprint offset services. In turn, the agent verifies the location of the building, works out an applicable coefficient of CO2 emissions and then synchronizes this data with a partner project [DAO IPCI](http://ipci.io/), to determine the number of carbon credits from the green finance market that are required to offset the building’s carbon footprint. These operations were successfully executed on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n### The solution to the problem\n\nToday, the Economy of Robots that we managed to build back in 2017 with our colleagues and partners, comprises a complicated at first glance chain, that acts as a final turn of the IoT industry evolution. The biggest issue we had was that we were amassing all the knowledge and realised our ideas, without having a chance to pass them on to anyone. Every new [scenario of the Economy of Robots](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/r-and-d-based-on-robonomics-network/), created during the development of Robonomics Network platform, was making the end product that little bit more complicated to understand for people foreign to the matter. In other words, one must be acquainted with multiple competencies and spend years to grasp the thinking behind intersecting disciplines that form the concepts of economy and machines working together.\n\nWhen you start to understand the nuances behind the development of an IoT application, it quickly becomes apparent that technical specialists must spend years to reach a fully functioning product stage. This is why we decided to turn potential users of our platform into co-developers. We focused on teaching them to become professional IT engineers in the IoT application space and as a result, we created Robonomics parachain and Robonomics Web Services.\n\n![DAO IPCI with Robonomics network](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-network.jpg)\n\n\n## Introduction to Robonomics Web Services\n\nIt is clear that the Economy of Robots is interesting to the public. Nevertheless, the main problem is that after a short while these users still flock to Amazon Web Services for IoT devices and start using that instead, without figuring out the critical advantages that the Robonomics Network carries compared to the renowned IT giants. This brought us to the conclusion that we cannot be about promises of completing something in the future without providing a real product here and now.\n\nTherefore, we decided that a range of real services must be provided to our potential users. Services similar to what other cloud platforms are offering but better. As a result, we created Robonomics Web Services, a product built on our in-house protocols and platform that uses an open-source robotics framework (ROS). We then dedicated 2 years to the development of the key functions that I will now delve into in greater detail.\n\n### The key functions of RWS:\n\n**1. Subscription**\n\nThe standard approach to blockchain services always includes transaction costs known as transaction fees or transaction gas. This means that when you make a transaction, its priority is dependent on the cost or fee that you are ready to pay for it. The higher the fee you pay, the faster your transaction will be processed. Such a model is not suitable for systems that rely on guaranteed bandwidth. You have to be absolutely sure that your device will be able to make a transaction at the set time and a predictable cost. This is something we don’t see often today, as transaction costs are fully dependent on the fluctuation of the exchange rates, at times reaching $50 in cost.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we have created a Subscription service, which is an alternative cost model on the Robonomics parachain for Polkadot. It guarantees execution of a prepaid number of transactions and assigns them a higher priority compared to transactions that are paid through fee model. To learn more about the difference between monthly Subscription and XRT tokens you can revert to my ‘[Heterogeneous tokenomics](https://blog.aira.life/rws-overview-part-2-heterogeneous-tokenomics-afc209cc855)’ article, whilst my other piece planned to be released at the end of December will outline the final architecture and interconnection of the two models.\n\nOur Subscription model does not only solve the guaranteed transitioning problem but also only costs $10 per device, making it an extremely profitable offering for the end-user. Moreover, it provides a stable bandwidth for thousands of monthly transactions, which is quite a stellar achievement.\n\n**2. Launch**\n\nLaunch is a very simple but economical function from the usage of computing power and blockchain point of view. It allows you to turn on or off your device and change its binary setting from 1 to 0 and back by sending a request to it in the form of a transaction. Since there isn’t much complexity attached to this function, let’s move to the next critical pillar.\n\n**3. Datalog**\n\nThis function works with telemetry and therefore requires me to expand on it. It works in two modes where you either save your IPFS hashes or store data on the chain.\n\nSo how do you use these modes? The on-chain datalog function is applicable when your data size is below four variables. There is simply no point in saving a chunk of data this small on IPFS (off chain), as bytes wise this on-chain log won’t be incrementally larger than the IPFS hash. We suggest recording the entire raw data inflow as a single function or opting for the IPFS hash. Then, Robonomics as a platform for developers will process the recorded data, be it raw or in form of an IPFS hash and decide where to write it to. This datalog processing will be hidden from the end-user and he/she won’t even notice the difference between two different types of storage.\n\n‘Liability’ is our final function but it won’t be released to the public until we know the goals that large scale Economy of Robots projects pursue. Another milestone product for us that we are working on is aimed at [Robot as a Service](https://blog.aira.life/what-is-robonomics-network-robot-as-a-service-and-future-parachain-of-polkadot-or-something-more-36deece9f3cb) framework, or as we call it, the ‘contractually obliged robot’ on Ethereum. [This infrastructure](https://blog.aira.life/robots-under-robonomics-control-overview-39337ac9fbbb) has already been described in full detail in our knowledge hub and implies a situation where the end-user uses our service tokens without relying on XRT or other tokens to pay for parachain usage.\n\n![The key functions of Robonomics Web Services (RWS)](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-rws.jpg)\n\n## What is the connection between RWS and the Economy of Robots?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the goals behind Robonomics Web Services is to educate our users and turn them into co-developers who understand the Economy of Robots. We believe that there is nothing complicated about this task as long as the user gets acquainted with the basic functionality discussed above.\n\n### Digital Twins\n\nNext step in applying the instruments provided by Robonomics Web Services is to learn how to create a Digital Twin, otherwise known as a Digital Shadow for the app. It acts as a digital version of the real-world equipment and copies all of its technical characteristics.\n\nWhat does this mean I hear you ask! Let’s take an intricate structure of sensors that measure the air quality as an example. You cannot make them do measurements every 5 seconds because their internal calibration and balancing of measured data takes 2 minutes. This is where a Digital Twin comes in, allowing us to make an app that is responsive to the user’s commands.\n\nAccording to the [Gartner report on IoT market trends](https://www.gartner.com/en/innovation-strategy/trends/iot-adoption-trends), 85% of the companies that were part of the study have already implemented or plan to implement Digital Twins over the course of the next year. Most of these companies have in-house engineering teams that work on proprietary solutions. Nevertheless, they all acknowledge that they have to rely on already existing solutions to be able to scale quickly and keep their services adaptable to the constantly changing IoT industry environment.\n\nThis is why our parachain on the Robonomics Network doesn’t only offer the aforementioned functions that are not available on Ethereum IPFS, but also allows our users to create Digital Twins of their devices.\n\nWe are developing this feature to let users build their own Digital Twins, interpret them on web services/IoT apps and most importantly save them as a model that will write the datalog. Our [Wiki](http://wiki.robonomics.network/) is being constantly updated with all the required knowledge to execute the aforementioned solutions and will soon be complete with basic information that explains a Digital Twin build from A to Z.\n\n### Applying Digital Twins\n\nOnce the data processing model is finalised and your Digital Twin is fully structured, you have to decide what will be its relation to the web service or an IoT application.\n\nAnalytics is often the common choice for such digital service, where a sensor sends you the data it measures (updates its digital copy). This data will most likely be subject to post-processing since it is highly unlikely that you are interested in the Pascals pressure value inside of your country house heating system. Instead, you need to know whether the temperature in the house is right and whether the heating system is still on. You basically have to decide how to apply the digital twin of the data that you saved on it and this is where additional services can help.\n\nNow, we shift to a complex scenario of Smart Building Offsetting, where a copy of energy consumption data acts as a digital twin. Let’s say that you want to save energy consumption data for a given flat and use the Datalog function with IPFS storage for it. If you are looking to find out the total amount of consumed energy, you would save it on-chain. Opposingly, imagine that we run a digital twin of the smart building. The Offsetting Service will frequently ask this digital twin to provide various data on energy consumption, then store it and after performing off chain calculations, connect/talk to Robonomics in order to provide required services.\n\nWe gathered such services in a specialised [marketplace](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services) that acts as an App Store for robots.\n\n![Decentrilized application, dapp in Robonomics network](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-dapp.jpg)\n\n## Understanding the Marketplace\nIn order to implement a model of interconnected digital twins and services, we must create a delivery medium for it or in other words an app on your smartphone. This marketplace, built on a decentralised ledger in face of decentralised applications, can be used to duplicate and create individual copies and digital twins for any required purpose out there via predefined templates. Most importantly, this is done without intermediaries and external storage, making our IoT services marketplace censor and centralized link free.\n\nLast but not least, let’s talk about the user interface. We strive to always offer our users most up to date online technologies and therefore grant access to decentralized applications. The greatest feature you get during the development of your Dapp, is the lack of vulnerabilities on your side. Whilst your app is on IPFS, it is connected to the ENS registry or the Polkadot ecosystem registry and hence the user is not faced with the vulnerability of dealing with a substituted app or a request when following the hyperlink. It is simply very convenient from the point of view of end-user application development and its maintenance.\n\nAnother advantage of decentralised applications is peer-to-peer communication. In other words, your app can communicate to its digital twin, the IoT service and the end-user application without a single point of signal decline, eliminating the need for third parties and intermediary resources when a task needs to be executed. This is what the [robonomics.js](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-js) is for, used in the development of [Dapp Robonomics](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/). We are currently in the process of adding a new iteration of improvements and will soon release a Robonomics Stylebook (an interface guide based on web3.js and polkadot.js functions), leaving you with an easy job of structuring your application right. As a result, we complete the full Economy of Robots chain.\n\n![Robonomics Network](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-network-2.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n* Our goal is to make [robots part of the economy](https://blog.aira.life/the-first-in-the-economy-of-robots-6f4bb115643b) but first, we need to teach the user on how everything works and set up.\n* To aid the purpose, we have created the [Robonomics Web Services](https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-web-services-and-rws-token-intro-d730ab50ad42) product that allows users to build apps and services together with us (subscription, launch, datalog).\n* Subscription to RWS resolves all transaction-related issues and adds functions that include: turning device on/off, telemetry (storage of a digital twin).\n* Once you create a digital twin via in-house templates, you can develop an IoT service and add it to our [marketplace](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services). The pre-structured interfaces in Dapp are used as a delivery mechanism that take your service to the end-user.\n* [Dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/) serves as a bulletproof way to establish a peer-to-peer (direct) communication with a digital twin, even when the service stops to operate. Regardless of the external circumstances, the market will never fail to work.\n* The aforementioned chain is a pathway to the Economy of Robots described in this article.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robonomics-logo.62c183a.55ad49b8c05f517a00fbc467115a9fba.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robonomics-logo.9ea8d39.55ad49b8c05f517a00fbc467115a9fba.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robonomics-logo.6b2ed88.55ad49b8c05f517a00fbc467115a9fba.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robonomics-logo.62c183a.55ad49b8c05f517a00fbc467115a9fba.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-1d10d0008b2a6602f9116a9a3c42b698'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-1d10d0008b2a6602f9116a9a3c42b698)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgABAQEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAABwYEAwIFCP/EAC8QAAEEAQMDAwIEBwAAAAAAAAECAwQRBQAGIQcSMRNBURQiCCOBsTNhcXKRweH/xAAZAQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBAIFBgH/xAAnEQACAQMCAwkAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADESESMRNBgQQFFBUiI1Fxkf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AKNp4HHTWxNyWRiONoDhVjGnloludqTXbTahyar/WsEjHsv7gabZhzsXjpDqUNibZWgULtZSkE%2bfb3Gvc9Mdr7m3HlnV7ReVGkRQA6%2biR6KkIXY4I5N0eBrX1UwW8NvSYTO858ibGccWqKXJhdBqu4gHlJII04rAPnM44JQgYM67u27tyFtWNkcJPKp7bwZkR1u9xUDdKAIB4oeONSUJdrSB765BD2UoRGnVKbIv1Hgav4utaIkHIxlpdbYKXEHuCg4jj9L%2bdGaope%2b31AIjLTC5JA579ZV4lQbWQtYQpJIKFAhXGkTbclNp50TsLyMh/1pKS4%2b4ui4t1FrIHN88nxzqywOQcgqR9SgD1E/b9wP7aLTcRWvTNto97fWlTKDQPNKPxqgjSkKUUA%2bNGe2ssVNJQjuVQugL1URZoQSoggfzFaI6A85VVUbFhCf8ADdFVDxeRyMSaC7JcDDzKU0WQjlJs%2be7uJ48AfOuv4jo31%2bFgz500JMJ70mWlJJLxcruFgcUE3/n3rRTsbdk3asXKuwrWVpbptSgEd3dXcRVnjjyPOvHfG8p%2b64ON%2btHphouEoSr7Cq%2bFAVYNGvJ1jj3f2/zXxWv2trXO1vja9%2bfW15s%2bLS4Gi3qkzOTj/p1egr832vvP7itJHRXpJE6i4TIz5OVfgriyhHCW2kqCgUBV2ffnRK%2baBOlNO9nuleExmNwbD6nZzImynxLW2HHFJFUkDihx59tXTuEIQnJi2lmUuBgTd1m6RxOnO14eXi5eTNVIlJj%2bm80lAAKVKvj%2b3RzgckoLJSqwAD8atI2/XuqjyNsbhjP%2bg4FOMPCYtRYdAISsJIo1ZFe4PtouiJVFnPMBfd6a1NlVV3Ua8fpqVGuBU0HNpB6TNT17Xx%2bWn0X0jzqhueLHDLzyX21tlaDQb4u1cHjjSNkXmUOZNTjxZSZKPuASrn0uBwAefk/90Y9EO5nD5bIsntktOMsBXetJ7V%2bR9qh8aqtw5V%2bY9nWnwCpqe19wUqv4VUASa8X/AFvTOXqRR1Cpif/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"AMA session at Robonomics community, Dec 11","path":"/blog/ama-11-12/","date":"December 15, 2020","description":"AMA session with Sergei Lonshakov, software architect at Robonomics.Network.

Today he is a big man in the academic world.\n\n**He’s [Dean of the Faculty of Infocommunication Technologies at ITMO](https://en.itmo.ru/en/viewperson/1564/Alexander_Kapitonov.htm) in St Petersburg.**\n\nAlso, he continues to work with Robonomics Network as a researcher, and help to involve students and professors to Robonomics vision, based on a scientific approach.\n\nFor example, [Fabio Bonsignorio](https://blog.aira.life/novel-ways-to-develop-robotics-and-ai-infrastructures-by-seamlessly-merging-new-financial-and-new-c43060de4fa) good fellow of Robonomics started to work with us after Alexander reached him in Academic fields.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nLets dive into the development updates you wanted to share with the community.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nRobonomics Developer diaries December 2020:\n\n1. **[Robonomics ready for Rococo Relay Chain’s relaunch](https://twitter.com/EnsRationis/status/1334407718384365568)**\n\n    This is going to be the last stop before Kusama Relay Chain is ready to connect parachains. I don’t know how long we should wait until Rococo v1 release, and when we can expect the Kusama Slot auction. But from the tech side, as I see Rococo v1 still has some opened issues on the Github that need to be resolved, and I guess in the next several weeks it will be done.\n    \n    No one knows, how long it will take to implement Rococo v1 features into Kusama. Maybe weeks, maybe months — let’s see and help parity developers on this way.\n\n\n2. **[Robonomics Web Services will be ready for the first testers soon](https://robonomics.cloud/)**\n    \n    Core dev team decided to launch the fork of Polkadot Relay chain with latest Rococo v1 updates and registered there Robonomics Parachain.\n\nStay tuned in Twitter, and you will be one of the first who will touch Robonomics Web Services.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nWow, it means that Robonomics development team helps core Polkadot developers to test out the Relay chain, fascinating!\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nFor sure! We’re like a second testbed for Bastian (main contributor of Cumulus) today I think.\n\n3. **We finished the XRT staking architecture, and it’s going to be something new for the crypto blockchain industry.**\n    \n    To understand why our staking mechanism is not the same as regular NPoS in Polkadot, we need to dive into its theory.  Staking mechanism in the parachains has to differ from the Relay chain’s architecture because parachains doesn’t have to maintain its security. And that is the goal for researchers and architects!\n\n    So, our team invented a unique stacking mechanism to achieve Robonomics Web Service’s monthly subscription payments. Beneficiaries of those payments would be XRT stakers. We’ll publish more details in our [blog](https://robonomics.network/blog/) soon.\n\n\n4. **[Robonomics Sensors Connectivity v0.5 released](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1335955941653704706)**\n\n    Supported humidity, temperature, pollution, GPS sensors.

Lets head to the last month’s most frequent questions from the community.\nPretty sure that everyone will be waiting for the article!\n\n---\n\nOne of the most popular questions from the community members is — **“When is the kusama parachain auction? And how do we support Robonomics.network increasing the likehood of success?”**\n\nI'll answer it by myself:\n\nIt’s important to notice, that there are no Kusama parachains yet. Polkadot’s community is waiting for the first parachain slots auction. [Robonomics joined 1st Rococo’s parachains party](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1296834125073125379) back in 21.08.2020.\n\nIn that regard, here is how it was possible to connect to Robonomics parachain on Rococo v0.\n[Rococo](https://polkadot.network/introducing-rococo-polkadots-parachain-testnet/) is a Substrate based testnet of Polkadot & Kusama.\n\n**Currently, we’re [ready for Rococo v1](https://twitter.com/EnsRationis/status/1334407718384365568) update, that will bring cross-chain communication for parachains.

I couldn’t find any info around this on robonomics site?”**\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nDAO IPCI is a Robonomics dev team’s partner since 2016. [Here you can find traction of DAO IPCI development](https://ipci.io/2020-strategy-announcement-project-overview/).\n\nA year ago we announced [Blockchain for Open Sensors Network Initiative at COP25](https://evercity.medium.com/blockchain-for-open-sensors-network-initiative-announced-at-at-cop25-3ca15c5a0d32) and that was the starting point for launching an independent substrate chain on Robonomics implementation.\n\nThe decision to make DAO IPCI a separate project is a long term strategy. **When we are ready to connect Robonomics as a Relay Chain to Polkadot — DAO IPCI will be one of the first parachains inside Robonomics ecosystem** as an IoT network of pollution measurement sensors for monitoring verification and reporting system connected to the [public blockchain](https://twitter.com/EnsRationis/status/1337302002401947648).\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\n**What is the destiny of 7 million locked XRT?**\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nIt will be locked before eth 2.0 phase 2 (my prediction, not earlier than Q2 — Q3 2022).\n\nMentioned XRT budget will be released only on auctions (there are no free tokens in that 7 mln), and only when Robonomics Network will unite its tokenomics on top of Ethereum and Polkadot.\n\nI find it as one of the most encouraging parts of all development processes of Robonomics as a platform, because it will allow developers to make a transaction with the same token on Ethereum or Polkadot networks depending on the choice.\n\n**One platform for robotics engineers with different blockchains under the hood — that is the mission of the core DAO development team in the long term.**\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\n**When will we be able to stake XRT?

The four high level goals are centred around Citizens/Communities, Business/Economy, Environment, Performance/Operation.\n\n> Q — How can Robonomics play a role in helping cities create opportunities within the space of Technology and Innovation?\n\n> Taking into consideration the approach to sustainability, climate change and importantly changing the mindset of people to open up and to try and understand the benefits of your role in a blockchain transactional environment.\n\n</Card>\n\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nA big part of our work is the vision of sustainable smart cities as described by the UN. Have a look at articles like that: [Smart Sustainable Cities. Reconnaissance Study](http://collections.unu.edu/eserv/UNU:5825/Smart_Sustainable_Cities_v2final.pdf).\n\nContext The [UNECE region](https://unece.org) is among the most highly urbanized in the world - with the rising share of the population…\n\nAnd our scientific papers like this:\n\n**[Trustable Environmental Monitoring by Means of Sensors Networks on Swarming Autonomous Marine](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2020.00070/full) - The article describes a highly trustable environmental monitoring system employing a small scalable swarm of drones.**\n\nSo, I think 50% of our research is the vision of developing sustainable smart cities concepts of IoT applications — try to deep dive into our research, ask our engineers (for example Vadim @vourhey ) and build cool stuff for UK with Robonomics open-source platform.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nQuestion from *SonOfTheSun* :\n\n> What sort of corporations, or rather, industries does Robonomics expect $RWS to play a role in? In other words, who would be the potential consumers of $RWS?\n\nI guess SonOfTheSun meant $RWS as Robonomics Web Services.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nThe same who use today [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/) or [Microsoft Azure IoT](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/iot/).\n\nHave a look at AWS and Azure websites to find who are the users of IoT services of these companies today, the same end-users / companies will be RWS customers in the future. Additionally, RWS will make more for companies IoT infrastructure, because Robonomics Web Services is truly global and can be a platform for companies who are now outside the customer services of Amazon.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nQuestion from *zamirakimov* :\n\n> Will it be possible on Robonomics platform to make robo-taxi infrastructure fully paid by XRT, including XRT payment bot, allowing payments not only for using robo-taxis but also for creating crowd co-owning service for robo-taxis fleet and even further for investing in robotic manufacturing of new robo-cabs to satisfy market requirements?\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nFor sure, why not :)\n\nStart here: **[Drone control with robonomics.](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/iris-drone/)** Drone activates after the succesful transcation and store its log with the coordinates in IPFS.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nQuestion from *bijikgelantungan* :\n\n> As an open source package for 4.0 developers, why should developers make Robonomics platform as their go-to platform? How do you support them? Do you have a developers’ training program like DevCamp or developer’s reward program?\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nIf you develop on Robonomics you have the support of hundreds of robotics from the box.\nHave a look at [robotics which can be used under Robonomics control](https://robots.ros.org) for your IoT application right now.\n\n**DevCamps was for Russian developers in Summer 2017, 2018 and we will continue online for English speaking developers this winter**\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nAmazing!!!!\n\nAnd the last one for today — question from *Ilyaboev* :\n\n> When will robots become autonomous economic agents?\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nRight now, in front of you.\n\nBefore the end of this year, our engineers will launch the X-Mas [Gaka-Chu paintings auction which was presented first time here](https://youtu.be/ReXFCqx5--s?t=1539). **So you will be able to buy artwork directly from robot-artist**\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nSergei, thank you for the AMA!
