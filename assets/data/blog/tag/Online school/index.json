You can connect to it and take a real-time photo of a nebula or a star cluster and our application will mint an NFT for you on the RMRK Singular platform!\n\nWatch this video from Chile:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Up8hESnXnaY\n\nThe telescope takes photos in real-time, so the app only works from 11pm to 6am Santiago, Chile, and when the weather is good and clear.\n\nIn this experiment, we wanted to look at the interaction between the digital and physical worlds. Think about it, using this application, you are essentially looking from the metaverse on our universe!\n\nWe see that the line between the digital and physical worlds is blurring, and despite the fact that this may seem like a scary trend, it seems to us that people will only benefit from this.  Cyber-physical systems are already being used to organize society and we hope that the tools that the Robonomics team works on will help developers create useful CPS that improve people's lives.\n\n<Card>\n\n### Now you can mint the Deep Space NFT here:\n\nhttps://telescope.merklebot.com\n\nAfter you have the NFT - you can get a special role in [the Robonomics Discord](https://discord.gg/JpaN2XAmqY), where we will discuss how to connect the metaverses to our real world!\n\nWe hope you enjoy it!\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Here is how the whole process will go:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/q7yaqlmrzZs\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.9e11803eac79f971ded8a7241e480bdd.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.9e11803eac79f971ded8a7241e480bdd.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.9e11803eac79f971ded8a7241e480bdd.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.9e11803eac79f971ded8a7241e480bdd.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-8ce2a64821ab99955d19b493c7ac1af0'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-8ce2a64821ab99955d19b493c7ac1af0)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQYHCAECAwT/xAA0EAACAQMBBQYEBAcAAAAAAAABAgMEBREAEiExQWEGBxMiMlEUQnGBFRYjUiRDkcHS4fD/xAAXAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAwQB/8QAJREAAQQBAQgDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxEhBBIxQVFhgZGhBRPR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCs1Jbaitq4KWkjaWpndY4413l2Y4AH1J1OFt7gIFoYVvF5nW4TZVVpYVaNWCliuWOW4Hfu/vqLO7e7R2btxZbhVuscMFQCZGGRHkFQ56AkH7atZebjcJXppqGNS0Co6s3hFA%2b1%2boSzHPAghl3H76zVyXMIw7YbV8Mm%2bvIZQgua2wLKqp2/7D1/Yu9ChrnSaKVfFp6mMELMmcZweBB3EcuowdLS0xPzAasx3wdt7Lb75S0VxstvvhRHkjjnwfhkcqR8rYLYJxuIAHvqDb1UWm5XirrYKRaCGeQutLB6Ih%2b1dw3fbnqnQF00Qc/rnnnB7jKCZ%2bwaHhLoo8/zF1h6Qr6WDfTRZ47bjytJrSkWNK2J6NnMiNtDaXI3ccj2xnPTVrmNA3JLZS48fCFS0ksL7E0bRvgHDDBwd4OtDEP3D%2bunrvL7Xp2sa2D8JpaCSjg8IvTjAkz7DkoxuXlk6RHXU7SC2yE8nNWiVqpUqa2OKX0NnPnCcATxII1IVDPe7Tb1gpL7URUKphIo7jE5Tf8AKMEqOgxv0tw23wDTTxyR%2bKOO1ECp8vNc6JQeMkcqKtCBLKZSfhRlScbgc5A3cNLlLJKGCOotKMn18V4LnZdqmkrkqRM%2b0WleaqV3fJ4gY2j9dY/K1WCoM9D5hkfxKn/j046PxTTAjENtHQUY9/r015qi2fFzNK7xIT8scOyBvJ4Z66Nsx3EgdlK%2bZu9ALlYZqCBZZZaaRWbZHhShznGeWuVppgTVNNupY4jJMR6iB6UB5bTFRpso%2bzkbgbUw82Qf0/8AeukfZVZKV4lrHUO3nATytjgcZ4jJ589E7UxNbTneitZJZtJ94tqRUiTRMWaNhHMCc42lDow6EFh9V66Ez06rCrDa2iATnGN/tqSvyaGicvcZNmRAsirHjaCgbPPkQDrA7t0ljUfijgY4eAP8tTH5DTMbRd6P4niRt2V//9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Lesson 2 / The Robonomics Whitepaper 2022.

The ideas presented in this document have been nurtured in our heads and hearts for a long time, constantly supplemented after various experiments and proof-of-concepts. We do our best [to report at conferences and publish in scientific journals](https://robonomics.network/papers/) some of the strongest results and materials. And for everyone's understanding and convenience, we have collected and compressed it all together as separate whitepaper chapters.\n\nThe first chapter is called \"At the Intersection of Cybernetics and Economics\", and it will introduce you to the rationale for the concept of the *robot economy* - an economic system in which devices act as independent agents capable of performing key economic activities previously unique to humans.\n\n<Card>\n\nWe will show you:\n\n- how the new challenges of the ongoing fourth industrial revolution affect the use of robotics and IoT systems;\n- what will be the future of fully autonomous cyber-physical processes;\n- why the answers to these challenges should be sought in the field of institutional economics, which seems to be far from robotics;\n- and what about cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Polkadot here.\n\n</Card>\n\n\n<Card>\n\nYou can read the chapter in the original in different languages at the links:\n\n- [The first White Paper 2022 chapter - English](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmaxrVWRkNJ9FZmcetE1gBfG3YUKHZifQP9tjmtPGFB3zi)\n- [The first White Paper 2022 chapter - Русский](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcAm42dMHQxBCyDzsEEezjPrGR9uNdUjAtoQwKr9dayxW)\n\nAfter reading the chapter, be sure to pass the test for the second lesson in order to participate in the prize draw. You will be asked 17 questions, and we hope they will inspire you to think deeper about our ideas. To pass the test, you need to score 10 correct answers out of 17 (60%, the standard value in academic practice).  Correct answers and a list of those who successfully completed the lesson will be published on the final day of the school.\n\n<Button link=\"https://lesson2.robonomics.academy/\" label=\"Take the Quiz\" button=\"primary block\" />\n\n</Card>\n\n\n<Card>\n\n## Stay tuned!\n\nIf you'd like to receive email notifications about lessons start and some helpful materials, feel free to subscribe:\n\n<UserForm comment=\"robonomics.network lesson 2\"/>\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.c066571146fa5f5339c9c8543f37dc66.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.c066571146fa5f5339c9c8543f37dc66.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.c066571146fa5f5339c9c8543f37dc66.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.c066571146fa5f5339c9c8543f37dc66.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-3d9d19e1232e4d69c101dff275c6ffbc'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-3d9d19e1232e4d69c101dff275c6ffbc)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bWc8ap1TNchfaaaFClMssYO8xgfJ2/cMEbwc541z2iYGNPCXyizdfpM5s8sbgGdFfaZ3lLo6bZUxuA6IIyGH4I/7rrtPPHXeqJevCdX4nnine/XG3rTRfTJ9FJhZAGJycEZxnGfceWk/jOlu4uNHRUwatjoKeFYFqalkE7Yw7vjtsDs8d47Os2XAidkmKJ/HPb5Tccj3NBIWplSOxqAdWXcpBHqDnVO%2bG18n8SeHJ5KhIEalrJKVRFIXDohGN2eRkHrvGD5406u96tlqYvcq2CjO0/wBIPl2BLEHA54yAPYaVOIBvbfnBqqslX8TkenqoPf1WspYlgZo53Ee8EfYT176eayuptdLSXSjuUsIht6BK5qlachkjLKFY/wCx2j15PprSbbc6G5w/Nt9XBUx%2bZicHHuOx%2b%2bjajith2ljSB39/upa4XV2i%2b9Cfp1Luz8r9gxA/jONF69rOZI9n0khWLQeqkoCxqFACgYAHAA0NU2CC9RmeVtssYaMYG4bSOiPP14613BwwOFODnDDIOo1SfVOrTcsqhQUZk4HI/tI1padPBC/xJj2r%2b2hSteRTFVvhpbaS2Ut%2btURCXOmrHraqPjDrKSEdceoj/PPfeu118GWW51UlVNTtJUysWlkldm3cAAAKy4AwcasCU0ccwlQMrgg8SPgkdZG7B60RLI0r7nCbvMquM%2b%2bm8nUYWvM%2bIdrj1sdfj3QmQuI2ychK6u1pW0UtJXGOaCSFIGURlPtXBA4b1GhbH4YtVkl%2bfb6d4allKOyO2x1JBwVYnrHBB89O9e0lLq2TKwseQQfwEVuOxpsL/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Lesson 1 / Broadcasting through the black mirror","path":"/blog/online-winter-school-2022-lesson-1/","date":"February 22, 2022","description":"Greetings to all participants of the Winter School of Robonomics 2022!

Technologies are already inexorably entering into our lives and very often technology becomes intertwined with our lives more deeply than some of us individually would like. Yes, there is a long-standing and difficult question from the field of philosophy about the opposition of the public and the private. But still, we want to implement and help grow web3 in the field of IoT now at an early stage, so that it would not be possible to change the name of everyone on the planet to an identification code in an instant and without their consent. The new generation of Internet technologies will help improve the relationship between humans and machines, make smart devices more independent and faster in providing services to people, and importantly, not give control of one person over another with the help of machines. This is how we see the best scenario for integrating robots into humans’ daily lives.\n\n<Card>\n\n### Do you want to try to see your reflection in a black mirror?\n\nLive stream on YouTube:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AMX7TWVbmgs\n\nTo complete this lesson, you need to install the polkadot.js extension (instruction: [Create Account for Robonomics Parachain](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/create-account-in-dapp/)) and request access to the Robonomics parachain IoT subscription in discord: [🚰winter-school-faucet](https://discord.gg/pYeyWJSc)\n\nAfter you create an account on the Robonomics parachain and request access to an IoT subscription, go to the dapp: https://blackmirror.robonomics.network/#/\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### To complete the first lesson:\n- Write a short message to dapp.\n- Sign the transaction.\n- Watch through the online broadcast how the QR code changes to a new one containing your message.\n- You can repeat as many times as you want - have fun!\n\n</Card>\n\n## Merch prizes and XRT rewards for Winter School 2022 participants\n\nEveryone who completes all the lessons of the Winter School will be able to get a full merch box in Q2 2022 for free with fast delivery anywhere in the world.\n\n### Composition of the merch box:\n- IoT-gateway created by us\n- T-shirt, Panama, Mouse pad, Pin\n- Calendar, Book #3 (R&D), Book #4 (WP), Robonomics Brochure, Stickers\n\n### Parachain native tokens rewards:\n\nEvery day, a reward for the completed lesson will be randomly drawn among the addresses that sent the necessary transactions and the participants who indicated the address at the end of the questionnaire. XRT tokens will be distributed as follows:\n\nThere will be 5 chances to win 32 XRT after the first lesson, 4 chances to win 64 XRT after the second lesson, 3 chances to win 128 XRT after the third lesson, 2 chances to win 256 XRT after the 4th lesson and 1 chance to win 512 XRT in fifth last day of school.\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.ccad2a7641bd7ccb10555a75209bf4b4.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.ccad2a7641bd7ccb10555a75209bf4b4.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.ccad2a7641bd7ccb10555a75209bf4b4.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.ccad2a7641bd7ccb10555a75209bf4b4.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-aef4ea93742a3dfd69d7c31c1b0f25b6'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-aef4ea93742a3dfd69d7c31c1b0f25b6)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAQUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwMEBQYIAv/EADEQAAIBAgQDCAAFBQAAAAAAAAECAwQRAAUSIQYTMQcUIjJBUWFxFiOBkcEnUqGx4f/EABgBAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAwQB/8QAJhEAAQQCAAQHAQAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxEEIUFxgZESEzFRYaHR8P/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Az9GjySLHGrO7kKqqLliTYAfN8G3KexWkhoIG4jr6tK6Z1i5dMVVI5D0S7Aljfb0%2bPciDh%2buTLM%2by2vlUtHS1MczAC5IVgTYe%2b2NO5pmdbmWV00%2bWTxykws8dQJIhG8vVX8Y3BuPLa3TrtjLM65Axz/C2jvWzrVnuu2Q22iygF2kcD1PBVdAHm7xl9Vq5FQV0nUttSMPRhcdNiPbcCnggi4NxjQ/axx5BlFTQ0xocuzWZvzjTVSa1hBW2oi2zMeg9gT6jAM4kzYZ3nE1etDS0AkVF5FKumNdKgXA9za5%2bTh8d5cyyb2aPuL0eq67lSi8OVp%2bZsAY3t0bof19P1w2PTGieCx/TbKxl9JA9aZDzHNMkjaSX33U33AxYpUAO7FANas7f2p0H2f4GGuDx2rJPlvC9BV93jhqZZVikXkKttQYHw222/jAIbzH7wBCUpkWSpiSQsEZwrFV1EAn0HqcWOGqlyedabLM5zmnpWJ5wiR4ypPk8G3mPr1xWY3aN1dCVZSGBHoRhzJmVbKztJVzOz6NRLXvo8n7enthHsLuSYGlNSZXl0s0zPXZpJPdjIWo3JLbHxE7333v8YiqjLpCYzQxVdREyauZyGAbc%2bXbcdN/e%2bOjnmaFmJzCpuxLE6%2bpIsT922v7bYTgzfMaeOOOCuqI0jXSgVyNI9h7D4wrWyDj/AHZBIKTjoahqqCnkhkiedgicxCt7m3rg79nvCiQ5JPmGcSVXdIy8EUUdSwuQBqksnQD0%2bTgFS5nWTVEE9RUSTyQENHzTqC73/a%2bL5lvFlfW0eqE92vtIqsSrH6P/AHGTObO5oDDS1Y5x2tJlJvleuPXqprivKXnp6eKCorKhHe/LlqDIsbAbHxf7wJK2nkpKyenmFpYnKN9g4N/ZxT/iTimGnzaR5aaGKSXQvgJa2kbj21E4E3HS6OMs6jG6xVckS/SnSP8AAxPAllMhikN0L%2b1bNOLI3zMcEb9DVVX78r//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Schedule of the Winter School of Robonomics 2022","path":"/blog/online-winter-school-2022-schedule/","date":"February 7, 2022","description":"The third Robonomics Winter School will aim to improve the user experiences of decentralized applications in smart device control tasks, including complex robotic scenarios.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\nThe participants of the winter school will have three lectures and gain a lot of practice using (d)apps based on the Robonomics platform.\n\n<Card>\n\n### February 22 / Lesson 1 / Broadcast through black mirror\n\nGreetings from the developers, an overview of the Robonomics platform, and the first practical task - to see your reflection in a black mirror.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### February 23 / Lesson 2 / Robonomics Whitepaper 2022.
