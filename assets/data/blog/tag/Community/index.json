Today, we all have one more reason to talk about our feelings, to express love and gratitude, to give something sweet and pleasant to our soulmate, friend - to whomever our heart desires.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\nimport Abstract from '~/components/TextAbstract.vue'\n\nThe Robonomics team, together with the [MerkleBot](https://merklebot.com/) project, has prepared another interesting experience with the Boston Dynamics Spot: you can connect to a robot-dog living in a laboratory in San Francisco and create a unique digital work of art with it. The resulting NFT picture can be added to your collection or used instead of a regular postcard - original and eco-friendly! The opportunity [to interact with Spot](https://spot.merklebot.com/) is available to everyone - for Robonomics this is an additional way to show love to the community<3\n\n## Can robots love and is it possible to love them?\n\nThis question should open up a discussion about the emotional aspects of integrating robotics into human life.\n\n<Abstract :style=\"{marginBottom: '2rem'}\" class=\"post_abstract\"  :text=\"`<b>Robotics</b> is a rapidly developing field of science that allows people to create machines that can safely exist in a complex human world, interact with its inhabitants (humans and other machines), perform some useful actions, usually aimed at improving the humans’ quality of life and in some way to simplify it.`\" />\n\nIt seems that there are only benefits from robotic progress, however, along with it, a number of ethical issues and problems associated with the use of robots in humans’ everyday life arise.\n\n## Spot and its lovestory\n\n![Spot Lovestory](./images/spot-nft-valentines-season/spot_lovestory.png)\n\nContinuing the conversation about the ethical and emotional issues of robots, Robonomics has created [a new conceptual digital art collection](https://singular.app/collectibles/kusama/b437f70371c8622e02-MBVD-2023/16627505-b437f70371c8622e02-MBVD-2023-MBVD-2023-00000006) that brings together two seemingly incompatible elements - Boston Dynamics' Spot robot-dog and Jeff Koons' balloon-dog.\n\nAt first glance, a robodog is a cold metal machine devoid of emotions, while the iconic balloon-dog, on the contrary, is a symbol of childish joy and playfulness. This contrast of symbols and images in this art object allows the Spot to be seen in a completely different light and encourages the viewer to think about the possibility of having a positive emotional connection with the robots.\n\nThis NFT collection is not just a tribute to art - it is something more, a kind of trigger that appeals to philosophical reasoning. The human world has never been so close to the world of machines, and technological progress continues to blur the border between these worlds. Whether it will be a peaceful rapprochement and coexistence or a collision at full speed is up to us. That is why it is important to consider the impact that machines will have on society and human emotions.\n\n## Movie for the evening and discussion over a glass\n\nIf you are interested in the ethical question raised by the love of modern dogs from the Robonomics NFT collection, then check out the movie [Her (2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/) and the old film [Bicentennial Man (1999)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182789/) – both ones are great for viewing on the evening of February 14th.\n\nAnd, of course, let's discuss!\n\nCan there be an emotional connection between humans and robots? How should humans approach ethical issues related to the implementation of robotics? What are your concerns?\n\nJoin the discussion on [Discord](https://discord.gg/dyFgwHfCN7)!\n\n<g-link :style=\"{textAlign: 'center', display: 'block' }\" to=\"https://spot.merklebot.com/\">Create NFT together with Spot</g-link>","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.24c5aabc0ef977ba387f0fd47cc2210c.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.24c5aabc0ef977ba387f0fd47cc2210c.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.24c5aabc0ef977ba387f0fd47cc2210c.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.24c5aabc0ef977ba387f0fd47cc2210c.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-52623b5a0126cc77d140044ef144a20e'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-52623b5a0126cc77d140044ef144a20e)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bkNF5ma2BaLH2mgOxsCuvvffFU%2bPUcNJMigsNbzBZTOrSfhl7zy0oAi8MeHeJUw9XL1uy1rM6JJdbdU6FFLySj7QF/1roR%2biMCEnNKHNkNNhtt0pRd0K74itrGi7KfbhXu%2bIPqobsTSRHYMVwVyOuh1ShzX91Cu/b8YVcGcU6vV8NRtdtNfOkOMSvqgqPIDaeYABIUK60Rft29sWTaypfObKibu8vMzH2R/E4pHUGgcpVzYafnOx48p1Ytcd96/H6xgcU8TaOdopsXW6zYMTJKGkKekS/mBSUdrHk10vvgpouI0w9SvV7nVMzY6pKZRdQ5yPFQFcpX5SR48Hz3vJcmPuinHFKH5N5B9U82nlbWUgm6HviIFmoVRxh8maT16H9%2bHNfiDiIyoK4msYchwiU%2bh1fzFKA910P1%2bMD31Wo1liS8tZJUokq6nKKjhrZq/Uc412LuWPZ7z/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Holiday Drops for Robonomics Community","path":"/blog/robonomics-holiday-drops-2022/","date":"December 31, 2022","description":"This holiday season, we would like to thank the community for the support and partnership.

Now the project has the ability to poll token holders of XRT on Ethereum, and critically we have a governance management tool in the Polkadot ecosystem.","content":"\n## Moving from Town Hall to the Forum\n\nIn the near future, something similar to the ancient forum awaits us, where everyone has the opportunity to share their ideas about improving Robonomics. If your proposal gains support from the XRT token holders, then the execution of your proposal is carried out automatically.\n\nHowever, it is important not to settle on using the Town Hall as our main form of Governance. Having questions that are prepared by the Robonomics developers to a vote, holding a meeting of XRT holders every 3/6/12 months is not the best option for the development of a Web3 project. As it currently stands, the Robonomics parachain has on-chain governance functionality, and there are no actual barriers stopping anyone in the community from starting governance proceedings (discussion / proposal / referendum). Therefore, by the end of October, instructions for creating proposals and on how to vote will become available, the result of which will directly affect the operation of, at least, the Robonomics parachain.\n\n## Snapshot & Polkassembly\n\nIt is impossible to influence the already existing Robonomics smart contracts in Ethereum. In the case of the parachain though, it is possible to change the Robonomics program code by voting. This is the main difference between [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/developers.robonomics.eth) and [Polkassembly](https://robonomics.polkassembly.io/) governance platforms.\n\nIn addition to requesting changes to how Robonomics works on the Ethereum and Kusama networks, the community can now use Snapshot and Polkassembly to create simple polls that can help draw attention to a particular topic or issue.\n\nAny XRT holder can submit a request to allocate XRT from the Treasury for any activity. There are currently over 370,000 XRT tokens in the Robonomics parachain treasury, of which the community can apply for grants using Polkassembly. Snapshot also has a Treasury mechanism. By the end of October, the developers of the project will agree on the amount of XRT that we will move from the DAO of the core team to the Snapshot treasury.\n\nTherefore, from the beginning of November, similar requests for grants will be available within Ethereum.\n\nAs always, any opportunity can turn into a double-edged sword, so we are ready for a little chaos and expect an influx of strange requests for funding (for example, meetups somewhere in Atlantis, at the bottom of the sea).\n\n## Why was there no actual vote on the fifth question?\n\nInitially, 5 questions were announced for Town Hall 2022 for discussion, but in fact, only the first four were voted on. In the fifth question, the project developers wanted to draw attention to the presentation of the Smart Home concept based on the Web3 ecosystem of IoT devices. For the Robonomics developers, the issue of producing the Smart Home ecosystem is a special point of discussion this year: we spend a lot of effort on presenting the concept of a Smart Home managed by a decentralized cloud to the community. We will need a little more time to complete the work, so we plan to present what we have planned in November.\n\n## And now to the voting results of Robonomics Town Hall 2022\n\nSince the voting went in parallel for the Ethereum and Kusama networks, each of them had its own nuances. On Snapshot, voting on 4 questions was available immediately, from August 28 to October 2, and we provided voting not only for XRT holders, but also for AIR and AIRA ID legacy token holders. On the parachain, voting took place sequentially, in an order, determined by the amount of endorsements received, the highest endorsed vote was pushed to a proposal each period. Voting lasted with a launch period of 7 days. Thus, the community has chosen the following order:\n\n1. Vote to Burn 7 Million XRT: from 30.08 to 07.09\n2. ROS2 Support Grants: from 07.09 to 15.09\n3. Parachain Gov2 Interest: from 15.09 to 22.09\n4. Home Assistant Support Grants: from 22.09 to 29.09\n\nPolkadot votes additionally have an execution period of 3 days on our parachain. Thus, the last vote was sent for execution on October 2, coinciding with the end of voting on Snapshot.\n\nTo vote on the parachain, holders must place their tokens, which are locked for the voting period. However, it is possible to strengthen your vote by locking tokens for a longer period (i.e. 10 XRT locked for a two-time period will be counted as 20 XRT). For consistency with voting on Snapshot, we decided not to take into account this modifier and count the number of tokens in a “pure” form.\n\nBelow are the statistics for all votes.\n\n## Vote to Burn 7 Million XRT\n\n<div class=\"big-table\">\n\n  |                        | Snapshot (XRT)     | Snapshot (AIR) | Snapshot (AIRA ID) | Robonomics Parachain (XRT) | Final results            |

project development management. The seven million XRT that have been hanging by the sword of Damocles since 2018 will be burned in 2023. In the coming weeks, the budget for the ROS2 and Home Assistant grants will be allocated and managed by the grant program. Regarding Governance 2.0, as soon as the new governance mechanism is launched in Polkadot and our parachain, we will contact the community and offer to participate in testing it.

Vote to burn 7 million XRT\n2. Parachain Governance version 2 R&D interest\n3. Home Assistant support grants\n4. ROS2 support grants\n5. Web3 smart home ecosystem funding forecast\n\n## General information about Town Hall 2022\n\nThe Town Hall will be the first meeting of XRT token holders, and we will discuss the tokenomics of the project.\n\n**Ways which you can participate:** \n\n- On the Ethereum network using [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org/). Direct Link: [https://snapshot.org/#/developers.robonomics.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/developers.robonomics.eth)\n- On the Kusama network using [polkassembly.io](http://polkassembly.io/). Direct link: [https://robonomics.polkassembly.io/](https://robonomics.polkassembly.io/)\n\n**Timeline:** \n\n- **Voting launch**: from August 28 to September 3;\n- **Duration of the voting period**: from August 28 to October 2;\n- Finalization and publication of vote results in our blog: mid-October.\n\n### Snapshot Voting Mechanics\n\nSnapshot allows token holders to vote on community proposals without spending ETH on gas fees. This is because you do not need to send a transaction to the Ethereum network, instead you simply sign a message with your accounts private key. You should vote with the address in which you hold ERC-20 XRT tokens.\n\n**The most important thing to remember about Snapshot voting:**\n\nIn order to vote on each proposal, you must have been holding ERC-20 XRT tokens at the time (block) that the vote was created. This means that if you try to vote on a proposal with ERC-20 XRT tokens which were acquired after the creation of the vote, your vote will not be counted.\n\nVoting type: [Single choice voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types#single-choice-voting). A simple vote, choose your response to the question. Your voting weight is equal to the amount of XRT in your account’s balance.\n\nWe recommend clicking the “Join” button on the main Robonomics page in Snapshot: [https://snapshot.org/#/developers.robonomics.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/developers.robonomics.eth)\n\n### Polkassembly Voting Mechanics\n\nThe Robonomics parachain on Kusama has recently added a user-friendly interface (thanks to our friends at Polkassembly!) which makes it easier for accessing the parachain’s referendum module.\n\nThe functionality of voting on the parachain is practically identical to voting on the Kusama Relay Chain. Therefore, if you have ever participated in governance voting within the Dotsama ecosystem, then you should already be familiar with this process.\n\nThe vote which is initiated on the Robonomics parachain will have the same vote options as the Snapshot vote on Ethereum.\n\nAn important feature of the vote on the parachain is the conviction mechanism, that could also be referred to as “**Voluntary Locking”.** With this mechanism you can increase the weight of your vote (voting power) by increasing the lock up period for your tokens (note: during the lockup period, your tokens cannot be transferred). For example, if you select a voting power of 0.1x, then the XRT tokens that you chose to vote with will not be locked at all. However, if you choose to vote with 1x conviction (voting power), then your XRT tokens will be locked for a period of 8 days. Read more about this mechanism on the Polkadot wiki: [https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#voluntary-locking](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#voluntary-locking)\n\nBookmark the voting page: [https://robonomics.polkassembly.io/](https://robonomics.polkassembly.io/)\n\n## Vote to burn 7 million XRT\n\nThis is the story of the sword of Damocles: 7 million XRT, which are currently locked in a Dutch auction smart contract on Ethereum. Is this a vestige of our project’s evolution? Or should it instead be kept as an untouchable reserve in order to one day be injected into the ecosystem to boost the development of the project? Read a detailed blog post about the history of the project’s tokenomics development in this article: [https://robonomics.network/blog/7-years-of-robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-xrt/](https://robonomics.network/blog/7-years-of-robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-xrt/)\n\n## Parachain Governance version 2 R&D interest\n\nGavin Wood help a presentation based around upcoming updates to the on-chain protocol governance mechanism during the Polkadot Decoded 202 conference. You can read more about this here: [Gov2: Polkadot’s Next Generation of Decentralized Governance](https://polkadot.network/blog/gov2-polkadots-next-generation-of-decentralised-governance/). Robonomics plans to migrate to this new version of on-chain governance after the firsts tests have been completed on Kusama. During the Town Hall, our parachain’s developers would like to know how many community members would like to participate in the parachains governance systems with the introduction of Governance 2.0. If you are interested, then vote “for”, if you do not want to participate in the development of onchain protocol management, then you can simply skip this vote.\n\n## Home Assistant support grants\n\nOne of the first, and the main use case we would like to advance for Robonomics in 2022-2023 is our integration with Home Assistant. Home Assistant has over half a million users, and is one of the best open source home automation solutions available today.\n\nYou can already purchase a Robonomics IoT subscription and [connect your home assistant to the Robonomics parachain](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/home-assistant-begin/). This will allow you to receive telemetry and control devices remotely, without the need to connect up to centralized cloud providers. These are only basic features, and there is demand for more useful services within smart homes. With this idea in mind, we propose to launch a mini-grants program (with grants <5,000 DAI) aimed at generating ideas and easily implementing them in the form of Home Assistant automation scripts (in conjunction with the Robonomics parachain). As part of this vote, let’s determine how much XRT will be allocated to the total budget which will support the grants programme for the development of Home Assistant use cases for the next 6 months.\n\nEvery 20 XRT which votes “aye” will add 1 XRT to the Home Assistant grant budget, every 20 XRT “nay” will reduce the budget by 1 XRT.\n\n## ROS2 support grants\n\nOur origins are in robotics, and ROS (Robot Operating System) was the first area of experimentation for us. ROS, similar to Home Assistant, is the most popular open source framework, but not for home automation, instead it is for complex robotics. The first version of ROS had many problems that prevented it from taking it’s rightful place within real projects outside of laboratories and prototypes of start-up projects. The ROS community has been developing the ROS2 implementation for some time now, and it is already a more mature solution. The Robonomics team wants to continue the development & integration of ROS2 in 2022-2023. As part of this vote, let’s determine how much XRT will be allocated to the total budget which will support the grants programme for the development of ROS2-direction for the next 6 months.\n\nEvery 20 XRT which votes “aye” will add 1 XRT to the ROS2 grant budget, every 20 XRT “nay” will reduce the budget by 1 XRT.\n\n## Web3 smart home ecosystem funding forecast\n\nThis topic requires an entire publication dedicated to it, so for now let’s focus on the first 4 questions as described here. This topic will be described separately closer to mid-September.\n\n## Join the discussion on Discord!\n\nJoin the discussions in the [Robonomics Discord server](https://discord.gg/9ZSpkET9BQ) throughout September!\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.b2a67a980ec429e0921f8ebe0ecfd51a.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.b2a67a980ec429e0921f8ebe0ecfd51a.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.b2a67a980ec429e0921f8ebe0ecfd51a.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.b2a67a980ec429e0921f8ebe0ecfd51a.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-3e94ad5626a8d54e022703866108449d'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-3e94ad5626a8d54e022703866108449d)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bCOlbfXNbm9so7K3guY7NLKNXf426I3SknOz/Ffzzkk8V1DVpUGVrmHEytxo97b3E0MkaB4pGjYe9UfMDg9T6UqIH%2bIEJGX3BcKc8/artvZSQZLatonU8/Fg9Pt37eagXTZbG5twl9YrI7sFlWY/IVGecDgHPB81EYaZjLetDllZf20tldzW9xE8UsTFHjf6lIPIPqKdutFuYGjUNDIWUMcOF2kgHB3Y81YatpN3NdwG71XS7me5z/NF4HK7VHDk9OMAZ7jFJXGl3TXkNrPeWr8MEkNwGjUKM/V2HioWBOhmkIy0YaxOXT7mNkUxqzOcKEdXJ/BNBeWr2kojmK%2b82hioOduexqxuorjQzGIrizfeSGNu2/djHU%2bOeMVUSO0jszsWYnJJOSaypYmu0absy4HdqcQnyAHhuT7U4N4NM2wBilztPK9cefUGlqlimMSMoGQxB%2bojp/o1s2ihtHnSMO3EQYcjOzHf0rxEiEhC7ORnkpgfpUJ1B97MFwWGOJH4/WhF6wAG3p1%2bdufU80mMLEpaJ9J%2bJKRE8bqWiGT2KDnt26Ut/TAAbJc5O7BGD4xxXGaM4xbxj7t%2b9cZoyci3jHplv3oyoV2Px9wqoRsf3rAf3WB7pXB77sf8oKOR1cjbGqY8EnP5oKMtoZbT//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics officially launches the Ambassador Program!","path":"/blog/robonomics-officially-launches-the-ambassador-program/","date":"April 17, 2022","description":"The Robonomics team invites everyone who is passionate about the idea of the project, and is ready to contribute to the development and promotion of Robonomics in the international arena for cooperation.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\nimport RoboList from '~/components/blocks/List.vue'\nimport RoboListItem from '~/components/blocks/ListItem.vue'\n\nOver the past years, the Robonomics project has been developing dynamically.
