For example, Boston Dynamics, a well-known robotics company, had more than 25 years of R&D under its belt when it launched its first fully-fledged commercial product. Another good example of simpler-looking IoT solutions: Zigbee, MQTT and LoRa protocols, but they were born back in the middle of the 2000s. Do not forget about this when looking at the history of the formation of the Robonomics project, which is at the intersection of robotics and new Internet technologies.\n\n*On our website you can see the project development trajectory starting from the first experiments in 2015: [https://robonomics.network/timeline/](https://robonomics.network/timeline/)*\n\nWe will soon have our first community vote, it will be in regards as to the fate of 7 million XRT that hangs over us like a sword of Damocles today.\n\n## XRT Initial Distribution History\n\nHaving started in 2015 with the first experiments and publications on the use of smart contracts to control robots, by 2017 we had our first plan for creating Robonomics to implement additional Ethereum features for [Robot-as-a-Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_as_a_service) tasks. We then carried out the initial distribution of XRT tokens, distributing 10% of the proposed initial emission amongst the community and to the first developers of the project.\n\n![ICO Stage](./images/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT/7-years-img-1.png)\n\nThe project developers proposed to divide the remaining 9 million XRT between the DAO of developers (20%) and the community (70%), but this was to be only after the full launch of Robonomics on Ethereum, which was planned in 2018-2019.\n\nAnd then the crypto winter came...\n\nWe launched the beta version of Robonomics in 2018, and in April 2019 we released version [1.0.0](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics_contracts/releases/tag/v1.0) of the Robonomics smart contracts.\n\nBy the end of 2018, the projects main goals were to keep the core team, and to continue working in anticipation of the launch of Ethereum 2.0, which at the time seemed realistically possible by 2020. \n\nWe decided to postpone the distribution of the community’s 70% of the XRT initial supply until the launch of Ethereum 2.0, with the belief that this event, regardless of the general market sentiment, will be more appopriate. The remaining 20% of XRT was agreed by the developer DAO to not be utilized until the community is activated, which was supposed to be around the same time as the Serenity release. In general, for us, the release of Ethereum 2.0 was the metaphorical lighthouse during the blizzard of the crypto winter.\n\n![Ethereum 1.0 Stage](./images/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT/7-years-img-2.png)\n\nIt was a difficult time for us, we lost some of our dear project participants, and every month the situation did not get easier. Fortunately, work on Robonomics continued to be maintained by a group of 5-6 developers. That year, we decided to try out a new blockchain, similar (but a little different) to Ethereum 2.0. This blockchain was proposed by the Parity team, who were already familiar faces for the entire Ethereum community, and it was also led by Gavin Wood. That is how we started working on the Robonomics implementation for Polkadot.\n\nBy mid-2019, the Robonomics development team was one of the first to launch their own network/blockchain on Substrate. And by the spring of 2020, the implementation of Robonomics for Polkadot already had almost all the basic functionality that we wanted to present to the crypto community before entering the IoT market. We worked without money for several years, eating Chinese noodles and drawing diagrams.\n\nThen a small miracle happened...\n\nThe emergence of a large-scale DeFi segment (in particular, Uniswap in 2020), the interest of the entire crypto community in Polkadot projects, and the presence of an existing Ethereum-based tokenomics have moved interest in XRT off the ground.\n\nThe community has grown substantially by 2021 - the number of holders of XRT tokens has multiplied compared to 2017, the token began to be traded on many exchanges. Around Robonomics, life began to boil, the project continued its development after the crypto winter. Today it is important to focus on the future for the entire community, and not on trying to implement the plans of 2017 after 5 years. Thus, the question arose: what to do with 70% of the initial emission, which has turned into a sword of Damocles for the entire community?\n\n![Token contract overview](./images/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT/7-years-img-3.png)\n\n## Robonomics Town Hall Summer 2022\n\nDuring the last week of August (August 28-September 3), be ready to participate in the discussion and voting with XRT tokens on the development of the project for the first time.\n\nThe article you just read refers to the accompanying information for voting on the issue of burning 7 million XRT tokens. Below are 4 more votes that the DAO of developers offers to the community and which I will talk about in the next post.\n\nQuestions for the community:\n\n1. Vote to burn 7 million XRT\n2. Parachain Governance version 2 R&D\n3. ROS2 support grants\n4. Home Assistant support grants\n5. Web3 smart home ecosystem funding request\n\n## XRT burn voting mechanism\n\nRobonomics already lives on top of two networks. We will vote in the most convenient ways for Ethereum and Kusama. In the case of Ethereum, we chose Snapshot, and in the case of Polkadot, the native Governance v1 referendum mechanism will be applied.\n\nAfter around a month, an XRT holder will be able to vote for or against. The weight of the vote will be proportional to the number of tokens on the account’s balance. At the end of the month, the values of the two votes will be summed up - if 51% of the total number of voted tokens is “for”, then the entire balance of the Dutch auction contract will be sent to the furnace (burnt). If 51% of the votes are “against”, then we will explore other options to determine the further distribution of the tokens from the auction balance. Or, perhaps we will hold an auction of 7 million tokens on the day of the launch of Ethereum 2.0, as we planned 5 years ago, but in all likelihood in 2032 😄","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT.62c183a.996bf22f5799c4278139f8006c6d21ec.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT.9ea8d39.996bf22f5799c4278139f8006c6d21ec.jpg 480w","/assets/static/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT.6b2ed88.996bf22f5799c4278139f8006c6d21ec.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/7-years-of-Robonomics-development-and-burning-7-million-XRT.62c183a.996bf22f5799c4278139f8006c6d21ec.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-b4284785caec4376ae5818d5304d1f97'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-b4284785caec4376ae5818d5304d1f97)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAQUBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEBQYHAwL/xAAtEAABBAECBAQFBQAAAAAAAAABAgMEEQAFEhMhMVEGQXGRBxQVImEyQlKhwf/EABkBAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEBv/EACERAAICAQQCAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECABEDBBIhQTHwIjJR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDAMMM0n4Y%2bHNA1fQtbXrcgIlOoLEZVG45A3cQfyJNCh%2b0HvnrQa5q4M20XM2z02nesJsJHmo9AO5xCKJFg0asdDklokiNBmx5MppuShCt5ZKwAog8kqvyvmR6Y9vIBk5GKqSBZkaoFKiDyI5YmPtWXFemPvQUcGOpw8NlTgUpCTzAsda6X2rOEWM5IXSdqUjqtZpKfU4viPtx76JrhRsxCoLJnDDJHUmIkRtLLS%2bNIu1rB5JFdBkdkKwddwE21WmbTZDicgkeaN0fy/Fjurhj2Dqc2BHmMw5DjLUtvhPpSa3pvp/noSPPGWGWK7nPHsHT1TeCEPsNqdfDFOHbtsfrJ6bRY98vVuwV6c18n4UkF4ojle7eBQH3OdgfM/nM4wodh7Zmybu4S96w0tUaNpxa8OhU1RQmSw5amqSlX3Krknt65VdY0z6Y4htUyNJKrJ4CioJ6edfn%2bjkdQ7D2wGNFAPJ4hFJJqz05YmGGVYqE//9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Update to Version 1.2: Staking, Tech Committee and Treasury","path":"/blog/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/","date":"September 17, 2021","description":"The project developers have implemented 2 important changes in the operation of the Robonomics parachain. The first is the inclusion of XRT staking, and the second is the launch of the first on-chain governance mechanisms.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Update 1.1: Staking\n\n### Theory\n\nDecentralized PoS networks ensure their security by locking the funds of the validators and all token holders on the network who participate in the selection of the validator pool. To reward validators and token holders, an analogous PoW reward model is usually used, based on the inflation + all commission fees in the block. This is how NPoS is implemented in Polkadot/Kusama.\n\n> Notably, both Ethereum and Polkadot include additional conditions for their reward models. Setting inflation targets, dividing the commission fees into several directions, and even burning a certain percentage of the commission fees are additional settings that both mature and newer networks are experimenting with in their implementations.\n\nParachains do not need staking in their core functionality. Parachains are secured by Relay Chain validators. This is a shared security model where the projects compete for slots during auctions.\n\n#### Reinventing Staking\n\nParachains that want to take advantage of the \"wisdom of the crowd\" and assign tasks to the community need to reinvent staking. At Robonomics, that's what we did. The staking architecture in the Robonomics parachain is unique and specific to the blockchain issues that we solve for the IoT market. We offer two ways to pay for the basic functionality of smart devices: per transaction or by monthly subscription.\n\nPer-transaction payment is self-explanatory. The subscription function needs a little explanation. Some IoT use cases need to periodically access cloud functions, and it is highly undesirable for these to fail. The gas-price mechanism still does not fully solve this problem, especially when it comes to guaranteeing transactions on every block. With this in mind, we came up with the idea of using the staking mechanism to manage a guaranteed quota with a subscription model. On the Substrate side, we did a little trick, based on zero-weight transaction priority processing. If an IoT device activates a subscription, then all its transactions will have priority over any others, except of course other zero-weight transactions. As more tokens go into the network's staking pool, more subscriptions will become available to users. \n\n<Card>\n\n*For example:*\n\nTotal tokens: 2,000,000 XRT;\nstaked: 800,000 XRT;\nparachain bandwidth: 5400 tx per block. \n\nThis gives us 5400 * 800,000 / 2,000,000 = 2,160 monthly subscriptions for IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\nI will write about how the subscriptions and the payment pool will be distributed in a separate article entitled “Automated Subscription Auction.”\n\n### Practical Use\n\nDApp ready to go: https://robonomics.app/#/staking/\n\n![XRT staking in Robonomics dapp, new bonding screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image2.jpg)\n\nAfter the first transaction, you will get a table of statistics like this:\n\n![XRT staking in Robonomics dapp, bonding list screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image4.jpg)\n\nSending tokens between accounts on the parachain will remain disabled. The ability to transfer tokens will be enabled after the parachain goes live on the Kusama network. \n\n### Observations\n\nAs of [block # 235,047](https://robonomics.subscan.io/block/235047), we have approximately one thousand accounts; the largest token holder is the treasury. Treasury funds will not participate in staking.\n\nThe remaining accounts on the network appeared as a result of using the Exodus DApp by ERC-20 token holders, or they were participants in the first crowd loan campaign in the Kusama auctions.\n\nThanks to the integration with Subscan, XRT holders on the Robonomics parachain can use this wonderful interface: https://robonomics.subscan.io/account\n\n![Robonomics Subscan.io account screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image3.jpg)\n\nOn the Exodus DApp interface, you can see the migration statistics from the Ethereum blockchain to the Robonomics parachain: https://robonomics.app/#/exodus\n\n![XRT from the Ethereum blockchain to the Robonomics parachain in Robonomics dapp](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image6.jpg)\n\n### Further Improvements to Staking Functionality\n\nThe current task for the developers is to test the basic staking mechanisms for token holders under real conditions: adding to the staking pool, accumulating rewards, and unfreezing tokens within 7 days. \n\n*An interesting task for the community:* check the correctness of the reward calculator, taking into account the two options: a 10% annual reward for participants in the Exodus migration and a 50% annual reward for members of the crowd loan campaign.\n\nAfter the 1.3 RWS update, the staking mechanism will go live on the network. The RWS update will add subscription capability for digital twins, and the challenge of bandwidth allocation will make sense. Accordingly, we will later be able to fully assess the correctness of the staking mechanism.\n\n## Update 1.2: Tech Committee and Treasury\n\nAs with update 1.1, this has already been implemented into the parachain work. The technical committee is currently made up of six technical specialists who have taken part in the development of the parachain during the last 2 years; the DAO [transferred 692,500 XRT](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6b9a9cbe7d21badf565ebce0fb50b865da8f5f784899db5fb455d1b276d14acf) to the balance of the treasury of the parachain by burning ERC-20 tokens through the Exodus DApp. The network's treasury and technical committee are the first elements of on-chain governance that the parachain developers have implemented so far. More details about each of them are given below.\n\n### Network Technical Committee\n\nThe technical committee portal is available at: https://parachain.robonomics.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmain.frontier.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/techcomm\n\n![The technical committee portal in Robonomics parachain](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image5.jpg)\n\nAs of September 15, you can see the six members of the technical committee that were added: 2 devops specialists, a software architect, the main Substrate implementation developer, a senior robotics engineer, and a senior DApp developer.\nThe technical committee will take care of updating the parachain runtime code, starting with subsequent releases on GitHub.\n\nYou can read more about the work of this committee in the Polkadot wiki: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee\n\nUntil the Robonomics parachain goes live on Kusama, the project developers will not expand on-chain governance by adding councils or referenda. After the successful launch of the parachain, we will revisit the question of new opportunities to influence network operations for new project participants.\n\n### Treasury\n\nThe parachain treasury is available here: https://parachain.robonomics.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmain.frontier.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/treasury\n\n![The treasury in Robonomics parachain](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image1.jpg)\n\nOver the past month, ~100k XRT was distributed from the treasury to the balances of participants in the first Robonomics crowd loan campaign from Summer 2021. These operations are not shown as requests, but rather done by Sudo. Now that we have a technical committee, requests will go through a vote. \n\nIt is also worth noting an interesting mechanism of the treasury: the periodic burning of balances. You can read more about the work of the treasury in the Polkadot wiki: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-treasury\n\nThe community can request that the parachain treasury allocate XRT for tasks that will be useful in the development of Robonomics in the Polkadot ecosystem or for attracting users from the IoT market.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere are many exciting updates to come, and each will open up new opportunities for the community. Updates to the project's community development program will soon be published with more information on what will be available to the community over the next 6 months.\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\" imageSize=\"big\">\n\nEnsRationis\n\nRobonomics network architect\n\nelement: @ensrationis:robonomics.network\n\n</Card>\n\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-notification.png'\" :link=\"'https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics'\">\n\n### Join our Twitter\n\nStay tuned and follow updates\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.62c183a.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.9ea8d39.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg 480w","/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.6b2ed88.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.62c183a.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-238be7fd79705754b94eb1b07ee8d544'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-238be7fd79705754b94eb1b07ee8d544)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bYI5ICe%2bQ4G4Ae4zkgj40bdr9PHXR0dEoYlQRJISRj%2bkZ7D5/x305lNK93C0IHSNaLlGoL49MkywW1lzlnSZ2XbkAEHH51LF4MkmyO3mNT6SXcHH3476qvTPXFXeVq7bVKlNc1ikMTRsTG5XuNrHgjg4PB76tfTlbNU25JJSZOAvm7CnmekZJX2Ocg%2b3HGklpG6vqqCakcWyixHz2/exRtItUKYtV/TiQHtCSRj8kZzqZZse37ajLIxxsgnl4z/KQtqQWTaCY5FGM%2bpCMfnQ8QGLqSxXN8HjH1W5Gf4Z/a/wDWrl4c%2bI94u3V1so7tJQpSTOVYpBtJO07RnPGTgaQtMxyNdDeCfTVuPRlbeq6BauSpWWMxOMBY07qD8kjOe/A%2bNe31ClpYIS4Ri5wMdVEHOJ3V88QZ5bXRrUW%2bWkhqGdEEckWTU5blQRgg49%2bw99UOmu1RRXyrkuMcIr1kY4J2pzg8e34%2bx0t5L5XV7xPU1E8ix5MKSSs4iBOcAsSfj9tFtcp55GklO53OSdDTabyWWfkndTyyFxwj6G4Vq3lLtFDHSVCbj2yGYjBO09vTxpzeGNQeqLbWVd3jjaaCo8qMwgoANobkZ75OkJNWSbda6orJlDBJHQd/S5H%2btLl0aOSHltwe/VdKt1eauqOfIAABYAbAeq62v1xo%2bk7DX3eVatqelTzJEjwWYZA4zj5%2bdKfqX9QNplsddDaaK5pcXiKwNURRmIP7bsPnGkPW1c7gq00pU9wXJGtJUMedZSeHoIxeU8Rv5faQZ3O2X//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Tech AMA [Robonomics frontier network, XRT staking, Kusama crowdloan rewards]","path":"/blog/ama-2021-08-04/","date":"August 4, 2021","description":"On Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Robonomics Software Architect Sergei Lonshakov hosted a tech AMA in the Robonomics telegram community.

Before the next wave of auctions, the project’s developers decided to deploy and maintain a functionally identical network.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Not a wild cousin of Kusama\n\nKusama Relay chain is under development and passes all updates using stable versions of Polkadot releases. For example, the current version of Kusama was built on [polkadot v0.9.8](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.8) release.\n\n![Kusama Relay Chain and Polkadot release 0.9.8](./images/Robonomics-Frontier/Kusama-Relay-Chain-and-Polkadot-release-0-9-8.jpg)\n\nFrontier Relay chain will use the same versions of Polkadot releases, which will be implemented by Kusama network in the form of its Relay chain.\n\nTo connect to Frontier Relay chain, you can use Substrate portal following this link: https://parachain.robonomics.network/ \n\nAfter connecting the Robonomics parachain to the Frontier Relay chain we can have a blockchain that could work in real-time and would be integrated into the Kusama network. It means that we need to overcome any challenges that Kusama parachains will have. All new capabilities that will appear with new Polkadot releases, will be also supported by Robonomics’ parachain.\n\n## XCMP and integration with Kusama parachains\n\nMaybe only one disadvantage today (in 2021), when we are talking about the lifecycle in a Frontier network and not about the main Kusama network, is a lack of integration via [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain#overview-of-xcmp).\n\nBut it does not mean that you cannot execute technical integration tasks and prepare a Robonomics parachain to work with Karura, Moonriver and Khala. It is those three parachains that are interesting for the Robonomics team in terms of integration. We can start maintaining work in a Frontier network with copies of the mentioned projects, but only after release of public documentation and first samples of using Kusama (how to create trading pair on Karura, connect functions of parachain with solidity/ink smart contracts in Moonriver, or to provide data privacy with Khala).\n\nI’m personally expecting that the process of parachains integration would be executed very carefully in the first year, and maybe other projects will also work together in sandboxes and after it transfer integration mechanisms to Kusama network. So, Robonomics could be in the Kusama network right to the moment of active integration between the projects.\n\n## Genesis block of Robonomics parachain in Frontier network\n\nIn the genesis block will be presented XRT balances of exodus participants, crowdloan contributors and open test network collators. This block will be formed only a few days before the parachain launch in a Frontier network. We will announce this update on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) and [Telegram](https://t.me/Robonomics_ann).\n\nWe are expecting that the genesis block will be formed during the period from 28th to 31st of July.\n\nImportant information for XRT holders in the Ethereum network: To participate in the parachain’s genesis block and participate in staking, you can use dapp exodus till 28th of July. After 28th of July the opportunity to transfer XRT tokens into Ethereum to Frontier will still be available. But this process will be executed by the technical committee of the network and not more often than once a week.\n\nAlso we would like to notice, that the exodus would not allow you to go back till the moment when Robonomics parachain will be connected to the Kusama network, and when there will be suitable bridge to Ethereum. The situation is ~ similar to the process of transfer to Ethereum 2.0 for ETH holders.\n\n## XRT staking\n\nXRT staking in Robonomics parachain aims to split the capacity between two options of payments: for transaction or for subscription. You can read more about this in the article [“RWS overview, part 2 “Heterogeneous tokenomics”](https://blog.aira.life/rws-overview-part-2-heterogeneous-tokenomics-afc209cc855) on Medium.\n\nThe basis of reward for the staking will be ~ 10%. This amount helps to launch the parachain. In the future, the reward will be determined by [Democracy pallet](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/pallet_democracy/) for XRT holders. \n\nCrowdloan contributors will get increased reward rate — 50%. Thus, it will help us to test the mechanism: “Parachain, which always wins”, which will propose adaptive reward for staking Robonomics to the reward for staking in Kusama / Polkadot relay chain and considering XRT price to KSM/DOT. We will explain later in detail about this mechanism and after a few tests. \n\nStaking will be available from the update 1.1 in Frontier network. Please note that tokens transfer in parachain will be turned off on the start, similar to the launch of the Polkadot Relay chain.\n\n## Roadmap - Life after auction\n\nRegardless of that we did not win a slot — the roadmap of parachain development won’t change. Below you will find our plans that were published in the article: https://robonomics.network/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/.\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 1: Establishing core functionality\n\nIn 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n* **Genesis state: (0 week)** Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.\n* **Update 1.1** Staking and allowing transfers (3 - 4 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for all token holders and 50% for Crowdloan participants.\n* **Update 1.2** Treasury and Technical committee (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n* **Update 1.3** RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n* **Update 1.4** Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n* **Update 1.5** XCMP functionality and Robobank (11 - 12 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n* **Update 1.6** Democracy and Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D\n\n2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.\n\n* **Globally available digital passports of products** By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.\n* **Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics** We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries. The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n* **Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits** It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n* **Fault-tolerant civil sensors network** A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.\n* **Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas** It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n* **Ecosystem integration updates** We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain. This is our vision of the future of Robonomics, as a complete segment of the Polkadot infrastructure specifically prepared for working with IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\" imageSize=\"big\" alignContentV=\"middle\">\n\n#### EnsRationis\n\nRobonomics network architect\n\nelement: @ensrationis:robonomics.network\n\n</Card>\n\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.62c183a.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.9ea8d39.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 480w","/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.6b2ed88.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.62c183a.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-c500a3a46c2e1383ad9128ddf93beeb6'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-c500a3a46c2e1383ad9128ddf93beeb6)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bPZ%2bNUV66/8ARGnQ5D9QXKKXmFMAPb2gENG5sCSeokXNgLWGTrn1a/aqhNcaoVPlNylvlDTTKy826L2G1JG8E4sLnQNQ7pVRJbiKQuGacxJ5smWW1tN3QWj3JIwf7x8jWpJi0cSkIQiMGgltKnNi7J6hcnySPJHfxqjw%2bpEeUxDLU1qaXVB8F1LXSMbQVDpOCDfW81%2bzyIRUy/M2OJSHEGQjIGbHo8Ht60SONhgzaASOffKpzNcJMi4gKFa4fp8ymS36aYrJYW4/zG0qSlxOMAKNwMYHi%2bfhAGnxEp%2bXDFPpTdRmR5CnU8oOpdKlAZVZOex7kZ0kOMOMuraeQpt1BKVIULFJGCCPB1XtkjsWCjXCmlEjchI699l0KhmNG2lUdt7Yb8tZO0/e3fVPiQpkblEJDilFRCQAB9h40K%2bgSMpOtrAtdmCn6Z7XQGLEcV%2bk78H/AFA4cpsVqFUqAqnKSWiqbTFkqWUKuCtCyb3uQcm4JGsPjVXDNLdVVOAuJ3%2ba8/zBA/TLQWAb5DhAGOw85xpImjr0Knspk1COyv8AgtYB%2b2l2bxgbMHRSOAJ/G7B/oEjc9EJWlcIsj6TDwvwfP4meS/JdcbaduUOL61um%2bbXP3yfWn9z6asQYTyBDn7XAlKlKcsL/ANDPr1rCbqzke3JbQhA7ITcJA9D41VqXFkshIDaRtP8AkXY%2bvPjTlpPCtZVAE939pRll1Wqk2diOgPpWoUWfwJX2qjQkmPLeCmmWJqAtDqTa4CsZB22v%2bdIdUlSahVJcueSZb7qnHbi3UTnVyoVB2c4FuixH%2byj/ANJ0OpnnNRZBSkOLQUKIH8inG4/NrfjXcvhdPp3jURtpx2K1YsmEBxsntf/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robobank.

Robonomics modules with XCMP support\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n![\"Robobank from Robonomics introduction, banner 2\"](./images/robobank-introduction/robobank-introduction-banner-2.jpg)\n\n</section>\n\nTo help the Polkadot ecosystem evolve towards IoT, Robonomics is going to provide parachains with the greatest possible integration with the most popular devices over the coming years.\n\n\nIf Robonomics is readily available, then the functionality of the parachain will expand in the direction of automating the services that surround us in the real world:\n\n\n* Acala will be able to integrate its DeFI instruments into terminals and payment points.\n* Plasm and Moonbeam will be able to provide control over the implementation of the terms of a smart contract to modern homes, offices, cars and any other IoT oracles.\n* Darwinia will be able to issue NFT tokens linked to 3D printer log, robot drawing or AI-generated music composition.\n* Phala will be able to increase the level of privacy of user applications, with which we control IoT devices in our personal space.\n* etc.\n\n\nThese are just examples that came to the author's mind, and you can try to continue the list yourself thinking about services for Smart Cities.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## Robobank is the first Robonomics feature using XCMP\n\n</section>\n\n\nA separate parachain provides specific functions, and the native token is used to pay commissions for performing these functions on the Polkadot network.\n\nThe creators of the parachain are limiting the capabilities of their Polkadot segment to increase performance, while the presence of other parachains and the ability to send a transaction from one parachain to another using [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crosschain) can achieve a network effect.\n\nEach parachain builds its own ['runtime' from modules called 'pallet'](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/).\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n![\"Robobank from Robonomics introduction, 3\"](./images/robobank-introduction/robobank-introduction-3.png)\n\n*Using the Ethereum architecture terms, the runtime is a separate virtual machine built for the tasks of only a few smart contracts.*\n\n</section>\n\nSummarizing the functions that are involved in a separate parachain, we get a complete solution with resource savings for “not the most important” capabilities for a specific project.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n> Parachains are the same as shards, but each is assembled in its own way.\n\n</section>\n\nBy being in [shared security](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-security#shared-security), parachains can create trusted connections between each other. This approach saves us from the fear of being in a cool but empty sandbox.\n\nThe presence of the Robonomics parachain will allow other Polkadot parachains to expand the functionality of native tokens by adding instead of the full and rather complex functionality of working with IoT devices to your virtual machine (i.e runtime), functions such as: pay for launching an IoT device or receive data from the device during the payment process.\n\nNext, we will look at an example of architecture using multiple Polkadot parachains in order to extend the capabilities of any project through infrastructure integration solutions based on XCMP.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## Robobank Architecture\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n![\"Robobank from Robonomics introduction, infographics\"](./images/robobank-introduction/robobank-introduction-infographics.png)\n\n</section>\n\nConsider an example of a truly decentralized Uber service.\n\nBy implementing Uber Parachain, developers could focus on the rating system of drivers, the system for processing user requests in P2P mode, and other customer service issues, and not worry about the need to simultaneously support the IoT component of their applications — Robonomics will help with IoT. Uber Parachain will only need to integrate the Robobank pallet into its runtime in order to provide customer access to the car after payment and receive trip reports directly from the IoT modules of the car.\n\n### Let's have a look at the diagram above and highlight the important points:\n\n* **Polkadot token** is a native parachain token, implemented for example through the assets pallet.\n* **Robonomics Web Services** is a pallet inside the Robonomics parachain, which implements the ability to connect an IoT device under the control of the Polkadot network on a monthly subscription model with guaranteed bandwidth.\n* **IoT app** is a custom application for automating the ordering of services, in which the native parachain token is used for payment. In the example with Uber Parachain, it would be a familiar phone application for city residents to order a taxi or search for a carsharing service.\n* **The car icon** is an IoT device acting as a party to an automated service, partially or completely providing a service. In the example, it would be a car, and by no means a driver! It is the car that would be the party providing access to opening the car doors and generating a trip report with telemetry data.\n* **Robobank Branch** is the Robonomics module for inclusion in the Polkadot parachain network.\n* **Robobank Tower** is the Robonomics module that runs permanently in the runtime of the Robonomics parachain and can launch IoT devices with an active subscription based on token transfer transactions in neighboring parachains.\n\nAs you can see from the diagram and the description of the modules, the parachains need to install Robobank Branch, which can be performed in the parachain [update mode](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-protocol-info#runtime-upgrades) without a hard fork.\n\nNow let's look at a step-by-step use case to represent the full cycle of the Robobank module after the Robobank Branch is enabled by the Polkadot parachain.\n\n1. `PaymentToRobot()` — this function can be seen among others in the parachain after the Robobank Branch module is enabled. As a result of a user sending a transaction from an IoT application, Robobank Branch will receive data on the amount of the payment and the device that needs to be launched for execution.\n2. `TransferToRobobank()` – will ensure the transfer of funds from the user account to the Robobank account with the ability to withdraw the accumulated amount in one transaction from the IoT device. For example, after making 10 trips or working within 5 hours, the car can generate automatic transactions to transfer funds from the Robobank account to the address of the crypto exchange. There is no actual movement of tokens from one parachain to another.\n3. `SignalToRobonomics()` — will be a function using XCMP. It is important to note that we will be able to ensure that messages sent on behalf of Robobank Branch are identified and marked as trusted. Some analogue of communication between smart contracts in the Ethereum network.\n4. `SignalFromRobonomicsBranch()`  — the message sent in the previous step will be sent through the Relay chain for processing to the central node of the Robobank Tower module. Having received a message from the parachain, Robobank Tower will record the request to launch the payment device in the Robonomics parachain, and thereby remove the need to store the payment log on the side of each parachain who uses the Robobank Branch module. In fact, the Robobank branches will perform the functions of correspondent accounts and are subordinate to the main branch in the form of a Tower, in which the full history of the execution of the automated service with payment in the neighboring parachain will be kept.\n5. `FreeTXtoRWS()` — two modules of the Robonomics parachain can trust each other, just like smart contracts in Ethereum. If we can ensure trust in the request from Robobank Branch to Robobank Tower, then in the same way we can provide the ability to launch a device with an active subscription not from the device address, but based on payment in tokens.\n6. `Launch || Datalog` — a combination of these functions will allow, for example, to launch a service for execution with an indication of the user who will have access to the back door of the car in the Uber Parachain application, or record the data necessary for the provision of the service.\n7. Steps 7-10 implement the possibility described in step 2. `TransferToRobobank()` to periodically empty your IoT device account by sending a transaction in the Robonomics parachain directly to Robobank Tower.\n\nAs a result, we examined the architecture of a solution using cross-chain transactions to expand the capabilities of a separate project at the expense of a common ecosystem.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## Current status and plans\n\n</section>\n\nAfter the first tests on the Rococo network, the developers will publish instructions for the implementation and use of the Rocobank module on the [wiki.robonomics.network](https://wiki.robonomics.network/)\n\nOur main goal is to prepare the Robobank module for the launch of parachains on the Kusama network in the summer of 2021.\n\nTo find out more, stay in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.62c183a.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.9ea8d39.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.6b2ed88.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.62c183a.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-fc595808566fddd7d9fd9cc6481a0493'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-fc595808566fddd7d9fd9cc6481a0493)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAQQDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgABBAcCAwUI/8QAKRAAAgEEAgEEAQQDAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQFEQYhEgcTMUGRFCJRYSNCcf/EABkBAQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBBAACBf/EACURAAEDAgUEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMREwQSITFBBRQykSJhcf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A84E1iaW6bdKhSNHPpn6eXHNjeTvfJj8daFUknZPNmcjYVV2NnXZ7oNx1q9/fQWkTxRvM/gHlbxQf2T9CrU9MMtlOFLcxuuJv8deOrPbteiN0kA6cHR%2bjo9arn9TkmZA4YYi5x7%2b9PafDhheLnig31D4bc8LzMdpNcR3dtPH7tvcRqVDqDogj6IPz/wBFC9Wf6grl%2ba8ijeWXDWcNuGgtrdb5WAAY%2bRLEDZJ0fror181WJBDEfYOqbB37De586aqJsmc29uE1PSp9VYRLX2d6HxWcME07FYIZJCPkIhbX4r0H6U8Wx13w7juQeKEXk7uPd/TRMylZioO2Qkn4%2b/qqYyWSvsDzfLXGJu5rS5hvZ1WSBjGepGH%2buvx8UlKKFxJbWeJgs8MkZJIHuKV3%2ba7HFcYuWyq2kpOjFIyKgVTIyqWC%2bZBC70f3EEDVSbPKX2e5PY3eZu5765aQHznkL68ewO99dDr%2bK2c4xaY%2beGVZppJJthi5HwB0OqwNcRXhbfEfq5GatYrXJXVtayCa3R9K5VexodbHR0djY6OtjqoKqd6AO/6qxfS3B2WXxV415Ery/rYYFZu9K476qJh8JbScj5MvioSwiufbUoGAIk8AQD0Oqrsna%2bQxjcJHxlrBJwUC04HW/o/dHWKxdpZ814i6RB47p45ZYnAKEg9gD%2bD11Uz1UtMal3eTWdgttO0kNwzI/wC3/KnkVC60AKfIdULXBwqF/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"XRT token distribution Q2 2021 - Q1 2022","path":"/blog/xrt-distribution/","date":"March 18, 2021","description":"Article provides a deep dive into the XRT distribution plan","content":"\n<!-- [![How to find distribution plan, guide for website, gif](./images/XRT-distribution/XRTdisthowto.gif)](https://robonomics.network/community#token) -->\n\n*Updated XRT distribution plan available at [https://robonomics.network/community#token](https://robonomics.network/community#token)*\n\n## Introduction\n\n[The previous Distribution Plan](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZjzJbZDhs7B3YhtRkvdg4jp6qpfkVGB67w7vH2nJBUrE/Robonomics_token_Polkadot_KUSAMA_stage_details_september_2020.pdf) was released by Robonomics developers DAO back in September 2020.
