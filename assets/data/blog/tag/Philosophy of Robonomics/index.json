This guide will introduce you to the basics of digital twins, covering their history, types, current industry standards, and potential applications in web3. Whether you're new to the topic or looking to refresh your knowledge, this concise overview will provide valuable insights.","content":"\n\nWhen people first hear about digital twins, they often think of computer models. Even experienced robotics engineers sometimes make this mistake. It's understandable because for a long time, computer modeling has been used to design things like cars or factories before they're actually built. Think about a 3D model you might see on a computer screen. You can look at its shape, figure out how big it is and how much it weighs, check how strong it is, and even run tests on it. But here's the thing: this isn't really a digital twin. So what makes a digital twin different?\n\n## Models and Their Types\n\nA traditional engineering model is basically just a *blueprint*. It doesn't describe one specific object, but rather a whole group of similar objects. (When we say \"object,\" we mean anything that exists in the real world and takes up a particular space.)\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"digital-twins-introduction/eng_1.png\" alt=\"Robot Class Model\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \"><i>A model is a description of some class of objects. It can be digital, but not necessarily. A model is primarily a description of an abstract, rather than a specific/physical object.</i></p>\n\nWhen a system is built using a blueprint or engineering plans, it doesn't stay exactly the same forever. As it's used, it starts to change bit by bit. Over time, it can become very different from how it was when it was first made. This is why it's important to keep updating our model or description of the system. We need to make sure our model matches what the system is really like now, not just how it was at the beginning. This helps us when we want to think about the system or use computers to work with it. By keeping our model up-to-date, we can make sure we're dealing with the system as it really is, not how it used to be.\n\nThis is how we come to the need to distinguish between general models (or class models) and digital models (or instance models). A general model describes a class of objects and its main properties, while a digital model adds to this description data that allows us to judge a specific representative of this class - its unique name, identifier or serial number, position in space and time, calibration coefficients, and other data that allow linking this description to a real-world object. This is why a virtual world cannot be a digital model if it is not associated with a specific physical asset, and actions in this virtual world do not lead to changes in its parameters in real life.\n\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"digital-twins-introduction/eng_2.png\" alt=\"Physical asset's model\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \"><i>Multiple physical objects can correspond to a single abstract object.</i></p>\n\nWe started this article with examples from technology and manufacturing. But now we're using broader terms like \"systems\" and \"objects.\" This is because digital models can be used for more than just machines. In fact, anything in the real world can have a digital model. This could be something as small as a living cell or as big as an entire ecosystem or even a star system.\n\nLet's provide examples of digital models from other domains:\n\n| **Physical Object** | **Class Model** | **Digital Model** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Citizen | Standard passport format | John Doe's passport |\n| Patient | Medical reference guide describing disease symptoms | Maurice Bruchier's medical record |\n| Automobile | BMW X5 User Manual | Maintenance records for BMW X5 (serial number: 29591376838) |\n\nThese examples are intentionally simple to be familiar to every reader. Note that all these examples mention models used long before the digital age! This illustrates a key feature distinguishing a digital model from a conventional one—the recorded history of its state changes over time, preserved on some information carrier. This carrier could be anything; data might even be manually collected and written in ink on paper. So why weren't these called digital twins (or models) before? The primary reason is automation—both in data collection and in the computations performed on this data.\n\n## Digital: From Shadow to Twin\n\nUntil recently, humanity was quite limited in its ability to work with information - to store it, copy it, keep it up to date, and perform computations on this information. Books and scribes were expensive, and libraries regularly burned down. In such circumstances, it was not possible to keep records of all objects in the surrounding world on paper. The computer era brought about radical quantitative changes in this area. Literally everything increased: the volumes of stored information, the speed of its collection, and the ability to quickly process and transmit it over communication networks to any distance. All of this together provided unprecedented ease in creating digital models for literally anything, and most importantly - human involvement was no longer required for obtaining and processing information.\n\nPreviously, information about the operation of devices was entered by people (for example, into some kind of graph or table).\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"digital-twins-introduction/eng_3.png\" alt=\"Digital model with historical data\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \"><i>A model of a physical object is a description of a specific instance, manually compiled and incorporating its operational history (log or datalog of historical data).</i></p>\n\nOf course, this was time-consuming, expensive, and led to errors in information transmission. The addition of microchips to devices and the development of the information technology industry made it possible to continuously collect information without human operators. While devices used to be released and then lived their independent lives (including modifications), now each smart device can provide feedback about its state and record historical data. The digital model can receive up-to-date data about the system's state automatically. In this case, the digital model becomes a *digital shadow* - a log of changes in the system's states during its operation, collected autonomously.\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"digital-twins-introduction/eng_4.png\" alt=\"Digital Shadow\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \"><i>A digital shadow is an automatically compiled record of an object instance, including its historical data.</i></p>\n\nIn the case of living people, digital shadows are user profiles on various digital platforms - online stores, social networks; for organizations, it can be the history of bank account transactions; for computers - various program operation logs. In Robonomics, a digital shadow is created by calling datalog, which adds another entry to the history of changes of the physical parameter we need.\n\nBut where did the concept of a digital shadow come from? Why wasn't this automatically collected log of system changes called a digital twin? To understand this, we need to ask ourselves why people keep records of historical data in the first place. The answer is simple - accounting allows us to understand how to influence a physical object to obtain the desired behavior. To implement a full control cycle, we need not only to be able to automatically collect data but also to automatically make decisions about changing operating parameters. Significant progress has also been made in this direction - humanity has learned to automate the calculation process, which allows predicting model behavior with changing input parameters. With classical models, calculations were performed manually - it was necessary to formulate the task, describe its conditions, and solve it by applying the laws of natural science and their corresponding mathematical equations. The automation of calculations provided the ability to simulate the model's operation, that is, to make it interactive.\n\nActually, a *digital twin* is precisely such an entity that automatically receives data (collecting a digital shadow), performs calculations on them (making decisions about changing the state), and then carries out some actions on the system.\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"digital-twins-introduction/eng_5.png\" alt=\"Digital Twin\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \"><i>A digital twin is an interactive model connected to a physical object that can automatically make decisions to change its operational parameters.</i></p>\n\nIn other words, it's a working computer program or simulation model directly linked to the control object. If the simulation model is not yet tied to the control object and lacks a unique ID, serial number, and operational history, it is called a *digital twin prototype*.\n\nDigital twins are directly related to the so-called 4D extensionalism - an approach to modeling the world where objects are not three-dimensional, but four-dimensional - the dimension of time is added to them. Such models reflect not only the geometric parameters at the time when the system was released but also its entire history throughout its operation, as well as its possible future(!) states. Moreover, data collection is carried out not only during a short period, as in classical control systems, but throughout the entire life of the system. Systems that allow linking different states of a digital twin over time are called a *[digital thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_thread)*.\n\nSo, after a rather lengthy prelude, we can summarize all of the above in a relatively concise definition:\n\n> A digital twin (DT) is a digital representation of a physical entity or process modeled with the purpose to improve the decision-making process in a safe and cost-efficient environment where different alternatives can be evaluated before implementing them.\n\n## Basic classification\n\nDigital twins are mainly distinguished by the time range in which they operate and how much data they can consider in the decision-making process about changing the operational parameters of their physical world counterparts. The terminology and classification, as in any developing field, are still being formed, and there is no single established meta-model for naming different types of twins. Nevertheless, we can already identify the following main categories.\n\n### **Reactive twins**\n\nThey perform operational control, continuously receiving data from sensors and changing current parameters in real-time. This type of twin includes *Model-Based control*, where a simplified model of the controlled object is embedded in the control program - for example, an onboard computer (embedded system) working inside the object of its direct control, which is very limited in computational resources, so the model of the object embedded in it must also be quite simple, but sufficient for effective operation. However, unlike a classic control program, a digital twin can exist \"separately\" - for example, in a virtual machine on a remote computer or in the cloud, so the simulation model embedded in it can be more detailed and therefore more accurate.\n\nThis variant of digital twins can also be called cybernetic. Cybernetics as a science describes control processes in nature and technology, and since any control implies a controller and a controlled entity, the digital twin is essentially such a cybernetic control agent.\n\nA reactive twin operates at a fairly low level. Its program must be able to interpret system service information - for example, temperature sensor readings of the onboard controller for internal use, to prevent overheating or other undesirable situations. The feedback method for influencing the physical twin is \"fine\" tuning of parameters without changes to software versions or physical construction.\n\n### **Digital siblings**\n\nIn literature, this type of digital twin is often referred to as \"what if” twins. These twins allow simulating some hypothetical situations that may occur in the future and take measures to prevent negative scenarios or improve efficiency. Unlike the reactive twins discussed above, which have a direct connection to the control object and are presented in a single instance, situational twins can be copied and deployed in any number of instances on any number of computers. The \"detachment\" from the control object lies in the fact that the simulation model is placed in a virtual environment where information comes not from real sensors, as in the case of reactive twins, but from a virtual reality created by us to reproduce a hypothetical situation, and the control action is carried out with the simulation model itself, not with actuators like motors or heating elements. These twins utilize external or cloud computing power, and therefore can take into account a much larger number of parameters than reactive ones.\n\nAlso, in this case, it is possible to change the course of time in the simulation model. Reactive twins must be able to respond in time to changes in the state of the physical twin, so they are forced to make decisions exclusively in real-time conditions. Situational twins are free from this limitation and can use, in addition to real time, simulation time, which can be both slower and faster than real time. Time slowdown is inevitable in cases where it is necessary to take into account a large number of parameters and, accordingly, perform a large number of calculations to use highly detailed simulation environments containing very accurate physics engines and environment rendering. Time acceleration helps in cases where it is necessary to produce a large number of simulation runs - for example, to form a dataset or for reinforcement learning.\n\nThe feedback method with the physical twin here is software updates - both system and decision support. For example, during multiple launches of the digital sibling, a program being developed for a robot to assemble a new product is tested, after which this software is loaded into the digital twin - the robot and production receive a new capability.\n\n## Industry's State of the Art\n\nNow that we have defined the concept of a digital twin and its main types, we can ask ourselves how these twins should be designed, implemented, and used in practice. Since a digital twin is a reflection of a physically existing system, the ways to describe them depend on how we understand this world as a whole. This is why the digital twin movement grew out of modeling, simulation, and predictive analytics systems, which reflects the actual state of affairs, because in reality all these systems are usually subsystems of a digital twin. In this regard, we can distinguish between the domain-specific and informational components of twin description methods.\n\nThe domain-specific component is related to different ways of representing knowledge about the system - for example, even a geometric model can have several variants - a CAD model to reflect the system structure, a dimensional model for movement simulations in physics engines, a simplified model with PBR textures for game engines, a model for highly realistic rendering. Additionally, models can be nested within each other - for instance, a car's gearbox and the car itself are often developed by different companies, but during simulation, the car model should include the gearbox model and interact with it in some way. In this regard, we can highlight the [Open Source Modelica Consortium](https://openmodelica.org/home/consortium/), which develops open standards to exchange dynamic simulation models such a [Functional-Mockup-Interface](https://fmi-standard.org/), methods of composition (see [System Structure and Parameterization](https://ssp-standard.org/)) for multi-domain modeling and distributed simulation (see [Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol](https://dcp-standard.org/)).\n\nThe other component is informational. It is higher-level and describes software interfaces or APIs for accessing information about the digital twin. Currently, there are many diverse standards, among which there is no clear leader. Now we can highlight the following key trendsetters in this direction:\n\n1. [Asset Administration Shell](https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/en/content-hub/aasspecifications) (AAS) by Industrial Digital Twin Association\n2. [Digital Twin Definition Language](https://azure.github.io/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/DTDL/v3/DTDL.v3.html) (DTDL) by Microsoft Azure\n3. [NGSI-LD](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGSI-LD) by European Telecommunications Standards Institute\n4. [Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/) by The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)\n\nMany of the mentioned standards are based on or strive for integration with a technology stack called the Semantic Web. This technology stack was proposed in the early 2000s by the founders of the internet as a response to the challenges faced by the first version of the web, which it did not adequately address. It turned out that it was not enough to simply physically connect computers to each other and ensure the transfer of information between them. For full-fledged interaction with each other, systems must \"understand\" each other, that is, have certain agreements on how they describe reality, which goes beyond the classical OSI network interaction model (on which the modern internet is built) and adds new levels to them. Subsequently, based on the set of Semantic Web standards, semantic interoperability standards also emerged, prescribing methods for aligning information systems with each other. These include, for example, ISO 15926, known in system’s engineering communities, developed to describe the lifecycle of complex systems, but which has not gained widespread adoption.\n\nThe internet has fragmented into large platforms or ecosystems, each reluctant to achieve \"mutual understanding\" with others. As a result, key industry players are hesitant to support semantic integration standards. This administrative, rather than technical, barrier prevents effective interaction between systems. Digital twins may face similar challenges, potentially unable to \"understand\" each other due to differing standards. Web3, with its emphasis on legal aspects (the administrative component), might reignite interest in this topic, potentially leading to a new evolutionary stage.\n\n## Linking Digital and Physical Assets\n\nBlockchain networks, as a significant part of web3, were initially formed around the financial sector, and their physical embodiment to this day are database state holders and validators. Both types of devices are nothing more than computational nodes that do not directly change the state of the physical environment - they have no sensors or motors. Unable to directly change their \"habitat\" environment, blockchain networks become focused on developing themselves and turn into a slightly more advanced, but still financial bubble, which raises doubts among the general public and hinders mass adoption of the crypto industry. Nevertheless, the resources that this industry has absorbed at the moment can manifest themselves constructively - in the ability to change the world and solve those problems that the modern global economic system cannot solve to this day. Including with the help of digital twins.\n\nWhen we talk about the ability to change the world in the 21st century, we primarily mean robot agents, so the topic of digital twins and their reflection in information systems is extremely important for linking the world of relationships of private cryptographic key owners (which is formally what blockchain is) with technical systems that are developed and built by people. Blockchain in this respect is quite simple - it usually abstracts from the semantics of the information stored in it - it does not endow transactions and accounts with any semantic content. Users fill it with semantic content by creating named assets (tokens) that reflect some idea. To this day, tokens predominantly reflect the community's faith in a particular company (in the case of Governance) or some expected utility (in the case of Utility). Moreover, Utility tokens are usually concentrated on IT services, that is, entities comparable to the blockchain level. And few try to make a token that could reflect the physical state of some real system. The physical state of the world is de facto assessed by market participants, often relying on unreliable and often contradictory information. Oracles can only partially solve this problem, as they can also be subject to distortions. This is where the growth potential of web3 and the mission of Robonomics lie - in ensuring that the physical world is directly connected to markets, and not through intermediaries in the form of mass media or asset holders.\n\nIn relation to real-world objects, blockchain assets can play different roles. Fungible tokens can be similar to macro-characteristics - they reflect the state of a large number of agents. Just as the temperature of a gas reflects some average indicator of the entire set of kinetic energy values of gas molecules, the token rate reflects the degree of society's interest in a particular project or development team. Non-fungible tokens have a somewhat different nature - this is a record in a decentralized registry reflecting some unique object that cannot be divided without destroying it. It is this property that makes NFTs suitable for real-world objects or digital twins. An NFT can act as a unique identifier for a system instance, containing a digital passport, a link to its simulation model for running simulations, and a datalog of its changes in the past.\n\n## Web3 as Internet of Digital Twins\n\nJust as the historical internet came to the idea of the necessity of a semantic network, Web3 will also have to take this step, but bring it to its logical conclusion. And there are already certain progressive steps here.\n\nIn particular, alternatives to DNS have emerged in the form of Namecoin and ENS, and immutable content-addressable resource identifiers (in the form of IPFS hashes) have begun to be used as links, guaranteeing the immutability of content. If we look at the fundamental standards underlying the internet, we can notice how, for example, in the [list](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml) of universal resource identifier (URI) schemes, in addition to traditional http, https, ftp, mailto, new ones have appeared - such as ipfs, ipns, web3, bitcoin, ethereum. Yes, web3 still uses the IP network protocol to connect computers to each other, but it already allows for significant abstraction from it, transferring identification to the level of cryptographic verification. The network has ceased to connect impersonal computers with IP addresses, and has begun to connect people as owners of cryptographic keys. You can be located anywhere, but having a private key allows you to be connected with other similar users regardless of their location, including transferring value to each other. This is particularly relevant for mobile robotics, where location can be highly variable and dynamic.\n\nThe aforementioned semantic web stack, as well as the possible reason for its failures, was largely built on the original foundation of the \"old\" internet. For example, on DNS, which is actively used to identify URI resources. DNS is a global, administratively managed routing table through which users could access network resources via human-readable addresses. This feature cannot provide the necessary degree of reliability when describing models of real-world objects for the interaction of automatic systems. For instance, when referring to any model (or prototype) of a digital twin in the form of a resource with a URI in the form of a domain, we can never be sure that the content of this model will not change to something radically opposite. This may be a potential growth point for web3 as a kind of interface to unmanned robotic systems through their digital twins. For example, we can describe a model of any system in the form of multi-nested [IPLD](https://ipld.io) structures (each level of which can describe a special semantic layer in the system model), record their addresses in the blockchain, and be confident that systems and devices relying on these models will never be \"deceived\" regarding their content. This can become a reliable basis for communication of autonomous automated systems in the future.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/png","src":"/assets/static/cover_eng.62c183a.cafb5ec8ecf175ade06d92bfac3c7b7f.png","size":{"width":1500,"height":676},"sizes":"(max-width:

2022","description":"The world of technology and smart devices are actively developing. New gadgets and systems appear every day. They help to simplify and improve human life. However, it is not the only task. One of the obstacles to robotic technologies is the high level of device cybersecurity and user data privacy. Robonomics developers have been working on this task for 7 years.","content":"\nThe creators of the project are working to ensure the safe operation of smart devices for users around the world using decentralized applications (dapp) that do not require the user data transfer for authentication. The creators of Robonomics presented various concepts and solutions, united around the idea of the robot economy in scientific research and articles. The essence of the idea is in the economic system in which robotic devices act as independent agents capable of performing key economic activities, previously reserved for humans. If the M2M (machine-to-machine) structure is set up correctly, then the robot economy can become an extension of the human economy, improving and accelerating its processes. However, the organization of the M2M structure presents various difficulties. For example, company owners risk to face significant costs trying to securely set up the exchange of technical information with another company. In this article, you will infer the theme and understand the inevitability of the robot economy. \n\n![Industry 4.0](./images/at-the-intersection-of-cybernetics-and-economics/pic_1.jpg)\n \nRonald Coase in his 1937 work [«The Nature of the Firm»](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2626876) argued that the complex hierarchy in the company creates more transaction costs (the cost of collecting and processing information), therefore entrepreneurs are looking for ways to reduce these costs. The reduction of these costs is observed in the sharing economy, the economist M. Manger wrote about this in his work. Due to the development of smart automated devices, entrepreneurs want to reduce organizational costs. Thus, the regular operations of most business processes of large companies are fully automated. We can assume that it leads to the emergence of robofirms in which the entire business process cycle is completely automated and doesn`t require human involvement.\n\nFor the successful implementation of robofirms, we need to build an established cyber-physical systems (abbreviated as CPS) - a strong unification and mutual integration of multiple computational, networking, and physical processes. It's a complex structure of many different elements: from the app on the phone to controlling the drone in flight, and only then processing by cloud AI. But what is the most important thing in the process of creating a CPS? It's to find a balance between sufficient and excessive number of automated elements in the service user supply chain. We should turn to the work of the famous mathematician Norbert Wiener [«Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine»](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cybernetics-or-control-and-communication-animal-and-machine-reissue-1961-second-edition). He argued that at first glance, completely unrelated theories can help each other solve problems. His approach has become an important part of the science of cybernetics and laid the theoretical foundations for various scientific areas - automatic navigation, AI, neurobiology, telecommunications, analog computing. We can find a connection between the teachings of N. Wiener and R. Coase: both theories consider independent agents who need to perform specific tasks at minimal expenses and transaction costs. Let's imagine a situation when cyber-physical systems are being introduced to the market, in its ideal representation - robofirm. In this case, robofirm forms an economy of robots, which inherits all the features of any economic system. Thus, the growth of robofirm (and, accordingly, the balance between the number of automated elements) will depend on the market, forming a self-regulating system.\n\n![Smart factory](./images/at-the-intersection-of-cybernetics-and-economics/pic_2.jpg)\n\nHowever, this system will have an important difference from the current economic system of people - the speed of transactions. Over the past 70 years the speed of accepting and processing transactions has become easier. Mobile devices can communicate with an automated banking system almost anywhere and anytime. The companies are actively using robotic process automation in the management of large business operations. Even today autonomous systems interact with the same autonomous financial systems. We provide access to robots to manage our money without our intervention to simplify processes and make human life easier. All this leads to the fact that the construction of more complex automated chains will begin, in which the processes will affect the exchange of both technical and economic information.\n\nIt's time to talk about the first digital cash that robots can manage autonomously - cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies will probably become the main means of accumulating money by robofirms in human society. We need a deeper integration of technical and economic transactions to take full advantage of this. The solution to this problem was first proposed by [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/). This platform introduced the first qualitative implementation of the concept of smart contracts — computer algorithms, capable of describing conditions, triggers and business logic for the execution of transactions. Robots have not only access to money, but also the ability to contract with humans and other machines. \n\nEven if the described-above tasks can be solved, Robonomics faces another problem - the high price (from 10 to 100 US dollars) for launching an IoT device using an Ethereum smart contract. Robonomics developers chose [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf) to reduce transaction costs. It is a protocol for building heterogeneous multichain networks.  It allows us to run our own independent blockchains, for which security and interchain communications are provided by a larger network. Another option is the Kusama network (Polkadot experimental network). It allows developers to create parachains and test different features and validations of Polkadot in a real environment. Robonomics parachain in the Kusama or Polkadot network will allow us to implement features that are not available to developers of smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\n![Parachains](./images/at-the-intersection-of-cybernetics-and-economics/pic_3.jpg)\n\nThe last question is the purposefulness of robots when providing services to people. The work process between people includes such qualities as conscientiousness, honesty, etc. Nowadays, it is difficult to talk about such things in the topic of the robot economy.

The ideas presented in this document have been nurtured in our heads and hearts for a long time, constantly supplemented after various experiments and proof-of-concepts. We do our best [to report at conferences and publish in scientific journals](https://robonomics.network/papers/) some of the strongest results and materials. And for everyone's understanding and convenience, we have collected and compressed it all together as separate whitepaper chapters.\n\nThe first chapter is called \"At the Intersection of Cybernetics and Economics\", and it will introduce you to the rationale for the concept of the *robot economy* - an economic system in which devices act as independent agents capable of performing key economic activities previously unique to humans.\n\n<Card>\n\nWe will show you:\n\n- how the new challenges of the ongoing fourth industrial revolution affect the use of robotics and IoT systems;\n- what will be the future of fully autonomous cyber-physical processes;\n- why the answers to these challenges should be sought in the field of institutional economics, which seems to be far from robotics;\n- and what about cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Polkadot here.\n\n</Card>\n\n\n<Card>\n\nYou can read the chapter in the original in different languages at the links:\n\n- [The first White Paper 2022 chapter - English](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmaxrVWRkNJ9FZmcetE1gBfG3YUKHZifQP9tjmtPGFB3zi)\n- [The first White Paper 2022 chapter - Русский](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcAm42dMHQxBCyDzsEEezjPrGR9uNdUjAtoQwKr9dayxW)\n\nAfter reading the chapter, be sure to pass the test for the second lesson in order to participate in the prize draw. You will be asked 17 questions, and we hope they will inspire you to think deeper about our ideas. To pass the test, you need to score 10 correct answers out of 17 (60%, the standard value in academic practice).  Correct answers and a list of those who successfully completed the lesson will be published on the final day of the school.\n\n<rb-button to=\"https://lesson2.robonomics.academy/\">Take the
