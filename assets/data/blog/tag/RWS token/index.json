The first is the inclusion of XRT staking, and the second is the launch of the first on-chain governance mechanisms.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Update 1.1: Staking\n\n### Theory\n\nDecentralized PoS networks ensure their security by locking the funds of the validators and all token holders on the network who participate in the selection of the validator pool. To reward validators and token holders, an analogous PoW reward model is usually used, based on the inflation + all commission fees in the block. This is how NPoS is implemented in Polkadot/Kusama.\n\n> Notably, both Ethereum and Polkadot include additional conditions for their reward models. Setting inflation targets, dividing the commission fees into several directions, and even burning a certain percentage of the commission fees are additional settings that both mature and newer networks are experimenting with in their implementations.\n\nParachains do not need staking in their core functionality. Parachains are secured by Relay Chain validators. This is a shared security model where the projects compete for slots during auctions.\n\n#### Reinventing Staking\n\nParachains that want to take advantage of the \"wisdom of the crowd\" and assign tasks to the community need to reinvent staking. At Robonomics, that's what we did. The staking architecture in the Robonomics parachain is unique and specific to the blockchain issues that we solve for the IoT market. We offer two ways to pay for the basic functionality of smart devices: per transaction or by monthly subscription.\n\nPer-transaction payment is self-explanatory. The subscription function needs a little explanation. Some IoT use cases need to periodically access cloud functions, and it is highly undesirable for these to fail. The gas-price mechanism still does not fully solve this problem, especially when it comes to guaranteeing transactions on every block. With this in mind, we came up with the idea of using the staking mechanism to manage a guaranteed quota with a subscription model. On the Substrate side, we did a little trick, based on zero-weight transaction priority processing. If an IoT device activates a subscription, then all its transactions will have priority over any others, except of course other zero-weight transactions. As more tokens go into the network's staking pool, more subscriptions will become available to users. \n\n<Card>\n\n*For example:*\n\nTotal tokens: 2,000,000 XRT;\nstaked: 800,000 XRT;\nparachain bandwidth: 5400 tx per block. \n\nThis gives us 5400 * 800,000 / 2,000,000 = 2,160 monthly subscriptions for IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\nI will write about how the subscriptions and the payment pool will be distributed in a separate article entitled “Automated Subscription Auction.”\n\n### Practical Use\n\nDApp ready to go: https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/staking/\n\n![XRT staking in Robonomics dapp, new bonding screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image2.jpg)\n\nAfter the first transaction, you will get a table of statistics like this:\n\n![XRT staking in Robonomics dapp, bonding list screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image4.jpg)\n\nSending tokens between accounts on the parachain will remain disabled. The ability to transfer tokens will be enabled after the parachain goes live on the Kusama network. \n\n### Observations\n\nAs of [block # 235,047](https://robonomics.subscan.io/block/235047), we have approximately one thousand accounts; the largest token holder is the treasury. Treasury funds will not participate in staking.\n\nThe remaining accounts on the network appeared as a result of using the Exodus DApp by ERC-20 token holders, or they were participants in the first crowd loan campaign in the Kusama auctions.\n\nThanks to the integration with Subscan, XRT holders on the Robonomics parachain can use this wonderful interface: https://robonomics.subscan.io/account\n\n![Robonomics Subscan.io account screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image3.jpg)\n\nOn the Exodus DApp interface, you can see the migration statistics from the Ethereum blockchain to the Robonomics parachain: https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/exodus\n\n![XRT from the Ethereum blockchain to the Robonomics parachain in Robonomics dapp](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image6.jpg)\n\n### Further Improvements to Staking Functionality\n\nThe current task for the developers is to test the basic staking mechanisms for token holders under real conditions: adding to the staking pool, accumulating rewards, and unfreezing tokens within 7 days. \n\n*An interesting task for the community:* check the correctness of the reward calculator, taking into account the two options: a 10% annual reward for participants in the Exodus migration and a 50% annual reward for members of the crowd loan campaign.\n\nAfter the 1.3 RWS update, the staking mechanism will go live on the network. The RWS update will add subscription capability for digital twins, and the challenge of bandwidth allocation will make sense. Accordingly, we will later be able to fully assess the correctness of the staking mechanism.\n\n## Update 1.2: Tech Committee and Treasury\n\nAs with update 1.1, this has already been implemented into the parachain work. The technical committee is currently made up of six technical specialists who have taken part in the development of the parachain during the last 2 years; the DAO [transferred 692,500 XRT](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6b9a9cbe7d21badf565ebce0fb50b865da8f5f784899db5fb455d1b276d14acf) to the balance of the treasury of the parachain by burning ERC-20 tokens through the Exodus DApp. The network's treasury and technical committee are the first elements of on-chain governance that the parachain developers have implemented so far. More details about each of them are given below.\n\n### Network Technical Committee\n\nThe technical committee portal is available at: https://parachain.robonomics.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmain.frontier.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/techcomm\n\n![The technical committee portal in Robonomics parachain](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image5.jpg)\n\nAs of September 15, you can see the six members of the technical committee that were added: 2 devops specialists, a software architect, the main Substrate implementation developer, a senior robotics engineer, and a senior DApp developer.\nThe technical committee will take care of updating the parachain runtime code, starting with subsequent releases on GitHub.\n\nYou can read more about the work of this committee in the Polkadot wiki: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee\n\nUntil the Robonomics parachain goes live on Kusama, the project developers will not expand on-chain governance by adding councils or referenda. After the successful launch of the parachain, we will revisit the question of new opportunities to influence network operations for new project participants.\n\n### Treasury\n\nThe parachain treasury is available here: https://parachain.robonomics.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmain.frontier.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/treasury\n\n![The treasury in Robonomics parachain](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image1.jpg)\n\nOver the past month, ~100k XRT was distributed from the treasury to the balances of participants in the first Robonomics crowd loan campaign from Summer 2021. These operations are not shown as requests, but rather done by Sudo. Now that we have a technical committee, requests will go through a vote. \n\nIt is also worth noting an interesting mechanism of the treasury: the periodic burning of balances. You can read more about the work of the treasury in the Polkadot wiki: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-treasury\n\nThe community can request that the parachain treasury allocate XRT for tasks that will be useful in the development of Robonomics in the Polkadot ecosystem or for attracting users from the IoT market.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere are many exciting updates to come, and each will open up new opportunities for the community. Updates to the project's community development program will soon be published with more information on what will be available to the community over the next 6 months.\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\" imageSize=\"big\">\n\nEnsRationis\n\nRobonomics network architect\n\nelement: @ensrationis:robonomics.network\n\n</Card>\n\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-notification.png'\" :link=\"'https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics'\">\n\n### Join our Twitter\n\nStay tuned and follow updates\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.62c183a.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.9ea8d39.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg 480w","/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.6b2ed88.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.62c183a.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-3fb09911923be9c00a7b02063b20564b'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-3fb09911923be9c00a7b02063b20564b)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAgEFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQcGAAECAwgE/8QAMBAAAgIBAgQEBQIHAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABQYSITETQVFhBxQiMoFxkQgVU5OhsdL/xAAZAQEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAQIEBQb/xAAoEQACAgIBAgMJAAAAAAAAAAABAgADBBEhBTEGEhMyM1GBkdHh8PH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AHigXP1HGtFo2BGPlI43fm7SMVGPx%2bNbdU83hRs7vyooLE%2bgGmkQfFLuplAmqU1jIOSs7MQfLpyjp21Zpd0SINLWooW%2bzmsEBuvXGRoHtnG1fdVkXbqNme0mWNQkRzBc/SxD4GCB5E4yM%2bxLeN9av8rBFCZHkHMPE6qmT1A9TnOcdB%2bRpUx7XYKo5lGsVRsmepG3x67SJQouQT1SyzLgdzkL3zrItu5lcR1aTRgZBM7A/kcuo3w3xxNc3afZbsC1rRaSOFoXzHIwyeUjyJHXvg6kHC9%2bxaohrLLLIoCtKicgdvMY7Ag%2bnTqNGyMvBm7Iwbsb3i64B%2bR7QjTFswu1uOvGwP0rG/P09yQOutnMcdl/YatNLjAEcr5/poW/1qy5ZAeSQAjOGQgj9fTVNgcEzLoznaH408TP3r7X/Yb/AK0f4a%2bKu9Xd62%2bC%2bm3RVZbEaSuImHKpYAn7tJCu2MaeX8PvDdLdZb%2b531WY12FeOJ1yv1qeZj6nHT8nXuczDw8elrPTHExedydbje47J27a7F%2bi1KvaiRmWWeLIfthMjrk%2b3njS5O62Y9/8bda8cU%2bEeOMthcFQACevXGD%2bufPUG4h3y5Y3O3SE9kbdWsyCvWknaRYgpKjBbr2H%2bdYPudiwweZuZsBfwBoMPp3pJt%2b5/f7AusLcCEZ9xs2OJP5nDWWtPDOzhychyM8px7ZJ99Nr4Y3ZOKxuJ3SJB8q0YT5cFM8wOc4PX7RpIS3JMEdtD5NxtQ83gTzRc3U%2bHIVz%2b2os6PW9JrX2vjOjm9YuzbVdxpVGgB%2bZ1xuMlbhzab26SG0IKsLTShQGJVRk4HrpW758f%2bHTtN2Pb4t0N5oXEHjVRyeJj6ebD9s4zpBX90vSIySXbTIwwytO5BHuM6jtlu%2bqYvh2lObm8x%2bn3gHILdp//9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Web Services and RWS token intro","path":"/blog/robonomics-web-services-and-rws-token-intro/","date":"February 25, 2021","description":"Meet the first RWS IoT Core services. Decentralized infrastructure services over IPFS, Ethereum, and Polkadot for Robotics and IoT. For industrial, consumer, and commercial solutions","content":"\n**Robonomics Web Services (RWS)** is decentralized infrastructure services over IPFS, Ethereum, and Polkadot for Robotics and IoT. For industrial, consumer, and commercial solutions.\n\n## Meet the first RWS IoT Core services\nRWS is a state-of-the-art infrastructure that you will love. RWS lets connect devices easily and interact with user applications, cloud services, and other devices securely. No single point of failure, open-source, most interesting internet tech on a turn-key basis, and your freedom to use it in any place in the world. Truly global network for Robotics and IoT devices.\n\nThe first RWS IoT Core services over Robonomics Parachain:\n\n* **RWS: PubSub Message Broker.** Use unlimited messaging over a p2p network based on IPFS protocol.\n* **RWS: Data Blockchainization Service.** Put data into IPFS and store hashes in a public Blockchain.\n* **RWS: Robot Actions.** Switch on / off; launch or stop your IoT devices under control of decentralized computer.\n\n## Let’s begin subscription model experiment with RWS token\nThe main token of Robonomics network is XRT. This is utility token which your robotics / IoT devices can use to pay transactions fee to interact over Ethereum today. Soon, XRT will give your robotics systems the same opportunity in the Polkadot ecosystem with Robonomics Parachain.\n\nFor engineers, Core Dev team will try to make different Robonomics usage models and the first step in this way is launching lifetime subscription token — RWS token. As Tesla promoted their roadster with lifetime charging, so we want to promote Robonomics network with lifetime subscription offer for the first. Become a robot economy pioneers!\n\n> ### 1 RWS token will give you 1 transaction per second (tps) from/to your IoT device over Robonomics Parachain.\n>\n> Just activate your RWS token and make more than 2,500,000 tx in a month with no time limits. Deactivate RWS token and trade it on Uniswap any time you want.\n\n**Example case 1:** You own 0.1 RWS token and want to share telemetry with shadow in Public blockchain every 10 seconds. You need to activate it with transaction to special address of ethereum mainnet smart contract. After that, you can use RWS: Data Blockchainization Service each 10 seconds (1 RWS token == 1 tps, 0.1 RWS token == 1 tx / 10 sec).\n\n**Example case 2:** You own 2 RWS token and want to control automatic car wash under Robonomics control. You need to activate it with transaction to special address of ethereum mainnet smart contract. After that, you can use RWS: Data Blockchainization Service and RWS: Robot Actions each second in parallel mode.\n\n**Current status of RWS token:** initial distribution stage.\n\n**Total supply:** 100 RWS tokens which will present lifetime using of 100 tps Robonomics Parachain bandwidth.\n\n**Distribution plans:**\n* 50 RWS tokens will be distributed via [Uniswap XRT/RWS pair](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x42018a2ff89b6d662b5f746277bd02f0d85f485a).\n* 50 RWS tokens will be reserved for academia and non-profit organizations.\n\n**Expected time to launch RWS token functions:**\n* alpha version — Q3 2020\n* beta version — Q4 2020\n\n**Further emission of RWS.** Benchmarks of Polkadot Parachains indicate that 100 tps is a small part of potential bandwidth of Robonomics Parachain. At the same time, Core Dev team want to make different types of subscriptions. From our perspective, RWS token is pioneers’ especial offer. And in future, we will focus on other types of RWS tokens with monthly and other types of limitations of using Robonomics Web Services for Robotics and IoT devices.\n\n## Conclusion\nRobonomics Web Services is the new branch of evolution in Robonomics project. Earlier, we only said we have Software platform, Decentralized network Providers, and some use cases based on our technologies. From now on Robonomics project made step on the way to bring something at least as good as Amazon Web Services but on the top of new internet technologies wave. It still R&D and experimental, but pioneers who would like to be the first in new fields are welcome! More Services in RWS IoT Core and not only in core will be presented this summer. Alpha version will start as soon as possible.\n\nStay tuned and [follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/logo.62c183a.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/logo.9ea8d39.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg 480w","/assets/static/logo.6b2ed88.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg 1024w","/assets/static/logo.62c183a.b63bc73a12e54ddb1b0d7961c6eaef95.jpeg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-f7bafff053f16303429b9f1d635e7c6b'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-f7bafff053f16303429b9f1d635e7c6b)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAwEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEBQMACP/EACkQAAIBBAICAQQBBQAAAAAAAAECAwAEESEFEhMxQRQiUWEVM3GBkaH/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/xAAaEQADAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARECITFB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwD6ppe%2bWYYOqalZlUFj8DJ1QE/HT3FxbeS7tfpZO7L4/IH%2b0MQGyPyMHHxmqJM%2bNuuM4OM1ksYuctLa9seQmitcF1aIFe%2bxs5wcaIwR81qLIsvkVc/bokjWxn/Pugk4GHPhTtjt1GcHI9UXZgpKr2P4zil7rGYozkltDA1of8rJ5GSy4rh7%2b%2b5e/mXj1zPJK7sPEo/BXeP1Qq96bK5xsYNGsfjo7SC6t/oluHjnh7rI0zuvU7GmJ/X73WxQ1vKy%2bHqBJBGBqjSyossTxvtWBU/2NDBFyjcir2X8alqytcKLnzsQViwclMe2zjR1R5ia7j4q7k4mGO4vljLQxM2A7Y0M0eP422sLG2tLZGENvuMO5cj38nZ9mqiAiMVUDXwKuXI2iaVTRPxs08vHW0t/D9NcugMkRYHo2NjIJH%2bjRaM3UdzDdxxNA2UADduykfII1XcAPGvcA6zsfqp77j7e8s7i2nQmGf8AqBWKk%2bvkbHoU%2bh2cKUAVQAMKBgCmrnDEkMEcSZCIoVcnJwPW66VAj//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"The ultimate guide to Robonomics, RWS and Robonomics parachain on Polkadot","path":"/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/","date":"February 25, 2021","description":"This article delves into the connection between Robonomics platform, its parachain on the Polkadot ecosystem and the Robonomics Web Services (RWS)","content":"\nTaking into account the never-ending discussions on the backbone operation of Robonomics, let’s investigate the under the hood structure and outline the main pillars of the network. This article delves into the connection between Robonomics platform, its [parachain](https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-parachain-on-kusama-40853780c709) on the Polkadot ecosystem and the [Robonomics Web Services](https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-web-services-and-rws-token-intro-d730ab50ad42) (RWS).\n\nThe Robonomics Network consists of multiple [repositories of code](https://github.com/airalab) that can be used separately in implementation of a fully-fledged IoT application. If you plan on connecting your smartphone for example to an IoT device, it is not enough to develop an app and link a bunch of sensors to it. Instead, you have to carry out a [chain of actions](https://blog.aira.life/simple-iot-scheme-990224363803) that will eventually lead to a connected IoT device and interconnected elements of the infrastructure, enabling the signal from the device to reach you.\n\n## The chronology of the Robonomics Network development\n\nSo how did the idea to create the [Robonomics parachain](https://parachain.robonomics.network/#/explorer) and [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/land/say-hello-to-robonomics/) came about? Originally, back in 2015–2017, we started with the development of a quite complicated solution we called the [Economy of Robots](https://blog.aira.life/the-first-in-the-economy-of-robots-6f4bb115643b). We are confident it is exactly what smart cities, industry 4.0 and the development of the IoT apps will come to.\n\nOur primary goal was to create software for cyber-physical systems that can manage autonomous and independent devices within the technical and economic transactions framework. Therefore, we decided to generate a technical and economy biased transaction and make it serve as a foundation for the development of more complicated processes.\n\nOne of my favourite scenarios of the Economy of Robots is called [Smart Building Offsetting](https://new.dapp.ipci.io/#/offsetting). It is a service that allows an autonomous building to collect and aggregate information on its energy consumption and then communicate it to another agent within the Robonomics Network, and even request carbon footprint offset services. In turn, the agent verifies the location of the building, works out an applicable coefficient of CO2 emissions and then synchronizes this data with a partner project [DAO IPCI](http://ipci.io/), to determine the number of carbon credits from the green finance market that are required to offset the building’s carbon footprint. These operations were successfully executed on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n### The solution to the problem\n\nToday, the Economy of Robots that we managed to build back in 2017 with our colleagues and partners, comprises a complicated at first glance chain, that acts as a final turn of the IoT industry evolution. The biggest issue we had was that we were amassing all the knowledge and realised our ideas, without having a chance to pass them on to anyone. Every new [scenario of the Economy of Robots](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/r-and-d-based-on-robonomics-network/), created during the development of Robonomics Network platform, was making the end product that little bit more complicated to understand for people foreign to the matter. In other words, one must be acquainted with multiple competencies and spend years to grasp the thinking behind intersecting disciplines that form the concepts of economy and machines working together.\n\nWhen you start to understand the nuances behind the development of an IoT application, it quickly becomes apparent that technical specialists must spend years to reach a fully functioning product stage. This is why we decided to turn potential users of our platform into co-developers. We focused on teaching them to become professional IT engineers in the IoT application space and as a result, we created Robonomics parachain and Robonomics Web Services.\n\n![DAO IPCI with Robonomics network](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-network.jpg)\n\n\n## Introduction to Robonomics Web Services\n\nIt is clear that the Economy of Robots is interesting to the public. Nevertheless, the main problem is that after a short while these users still flock to Amazon Web Services for IoT devices and start using that instead, without figuring out the critical advantages that the Robonomics Network carries compared to the renowned IT giants. This brought us to the conclusion that we cannot be about promises of completing something in the future without providing a real product here and now.\n\nTherefore, we decided that a range of real services must be provided to our potential users. Services similar to what other cloud platforms are offering but better. As a result, we created Robonomics Web Services, a product built on our in-house protocols and platform that uses an open-source robotics framework (ROS). We then dedicated 2 years to the development of the key functions that I will now delve into in greater detail.\n\n### The key functions of RWS:\n\n**1. Subscription**\n\nThe standard approach to blockchain services always includes transaction costs known as transaction fees or transaction gas. This means that when you make a transaction, its priority is dependent on the cost or fee that you are ready to pay for it. The higher the fee you pay, the faster your transaction will be processed. Such a model is not suitable for systems that rely on guaranteed bandwidth. You have to be absolutely sure that your device will be able to make a transaction at the set time and a predictable cost. This is something we don’t see often today, as transaction costs are fully dependent on the fluctuation of the exchange rates, at times reaching $50 in cost.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we have created a Subscription service, which is an alternative cost model on the Robonomics parachain for Polkadot. It guarantees execution of a prepaid number of transactions and assigns them a higher priority compared to transactions that are paid through fee model. To learn more about the difference between monthly Subscription and XRT tokens you can revert to my ‘[Heterogeneous tokenomics](https://blog.aira.life/rws-overview-part-2-heterogeneous-tokenomics-afc209cc855)’ article, whilst my other piece planned to be released at the end of December will outline the final architecture and interconnection of the two models.\n\nOur Subscription model does not only solve the guaranteed transitioning problem but also only costs $10 per device, making it an extremely profitable offering for the end-user. Moreover, it provides a stable bandwidth for thousands of monthly transactions, which is quite a stellar achievement.\n\n**2. Launch**\n\nLaunch is a very simple but economical function from the usage of computing power and blockchain point of view. It allows you to turn on or off your device and change its binary setting from 1 to 0 and back by sending a request to it in the form of a transaction. Since there isn’t much complexity attached to this function, let’s move to the next critical pillar.\n\n**3. Datalog**\n\nThis function works with telemetry and therefore requires me to expand on it. It works in two modes where you either save your IPFS hashes or store data on the chain.\n\nSo how do you use these modes? The on-chain datalog function is applicable when your data size is below four variables. There is simply no point in saving a chunk of data this small on IPFS (off chain), as bytes wise this on-chain log won’t be incrementally larger than the IPFS hash. We suggest recording the entire raw data inflow as a single function or opting for the IPFS hash. Then, Robonomics as a platform for developers will process the recorded data, be it raw or in form of an IPFS hash and decide where to write it to. This datalog processing will be hidden from the end-user and he/she won’t even notice the difference between two different types of storage.\n\n‘Liability’ is our final function but it won’t be released to the public until we know the goals that large scale Economy of Robots projects pursue. Another milestone product for us that we are working on is aimed at [Robot as a Service](https://blog.aira.life/what-is-robonomics-network-robot-as-a-service-and-future-parachain-of-polkadot-or-something-more-36deece9f3cb) framework, or as we call it, the ‘contractually obliged robot’ on Ethereum. [This infrastructure](https://blog.aira.life/robots-under-robonomics-control-overview-39337ac9fbbb) has already been described in full detail in our knowledge hub and implies a situation where the end-user uses our service tokens without relying on XRT or other tokens to pay for parachain usage.\n\n![The key functions of Robonomics Web Services (RWS)](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-rws.jpg)\n\n## What is the connection between RWS and the Economy of Robots?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the goals behind Robonomics Web Services is to educate our users and turn them into co-developers who understand the Economy of Robots. We believe that there is nothing complicated about this task as long as the user gets acquainted with the basic functionality discussed above.\n\n### Digital Twins\n\nNext step in applying the instruments provided by Robonomics Web Services is to learn how to create a Digital Twin, otherwise known as a Digital Shadow for the app. It acts as a digital version of the real-world equipment and copies all of its technical characteristics.\n\nWhat does this mean I hear you ask! Let’s take an intricate structure of sensors that measure the air quality as an example. You cannot make them do measurements every 5 seconds because their internal calibration and balancing of measured data takes 2 minutes. This is where a Digital Twin comes in, allowing us to make an app that is responsive to the user’s commands.\n\nAccording to the [Gartner report on IoT market trends](https://www.gartner.com/en/innovation-strategy/trends/iot-adoption-trends), 85% of the companies that were part of the study have already implemented or plan to implement Digital Twins over the course of the next year. Most of these companies have in-house engineering teams that work on proprietary solutions. Nevertheless, they all acknowledge that they have to rely on already existing solutions to be able to scale quickly and keep their services adaptable to the constantly changing IoT industry environment.\n\nThis is why our parachain on the Robonomics Network doesn’t only offer the aforementioned functions that are not available on Ethereum IPFS, but also allows our users to create Digital Twins of their devices.\n\nWe are developing this feature to let users build their own Digital Twins, interpret them on web services/IoT apps and most importantly save them as a model that will write the datalog. Our [Wiki](http://wiki.robonomics.network/) is being constantly updated with all the required knowledge to execute the aforementioned solutions and will soon be complete with basic information that explains a Digital Twin build from A to Z.\n\n### Applying Digital Twins\n\nOnce the data processing model is finalised and your Digital Twin is fully structured, you have to decide what will be its relation to the web service or an IoT application.\n\nAnalytics is often the common choice for such digital service, where a sensor sends you the data it measures (updates its digital copy). This data will most likely be subject to post-processing since it is highly unlikely that you are interested in the Pascals pressure value inside of your country house heating system. Instead, you need to know whether the temperature in the house is right and whether the heating system is still on. You basically have to decide how to apply the digital twin of the data that you saved on it and this is where additional services can help.\n\nNow, we shift to a complex scenario of Smart Building Offsetting, where a copy of energy consumption data acts as a digital twin. Let’s say that you want to save energy consumption data for a given flat and use the Datalog function with IPFS storage for it. If you are looking to find out the total amount of consumed energy, you would save it on-chain. Opposingly, imagine that we run a digital twin of the smart building. The Offsetting Service will frequently ask this digital twin to provide various data on energy consumption, then store it and after performing off chain calculations, connect/talk to Robonomics in order to provide required services.\n\nWe gathered such services in a specialised [marketplace](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services) that acts as an App Store for robots.\n\n![Decentrilized application, dapp in Robonomics network](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-dapp.jpg)\n\n## Understanding the Marketplace\nIn order to implement a model of interconnected digital twins and services, we must create a delivery medium for it or in other words an app on your smartphone. This marketplace, built on a decentralised ledger in face of decentralised applications, can be used to duplicate and create individual copies and digital twins for any required purpose out there via predefined templates. Most importantly, this is done without intermediaries and external storage, making our IoT services marketplace censor and centralized link free.\n\nLast but not least, let’s talk about the user interface. We strive to always offer our users most up to date online technologies and therefore grant access to decentralized applications. The greatest feature you get during the development of your Dapp, is the lack of vulnerabilities on your side. Whilst your app is on IPFS, it is connected to the ENS registry or the Polkadot ecosystem registry and hence the user is not faced with the vulnerability of dealing with a substituted app or a request when following the hyperlink. It is simply very convenient from the point of view of end-user application development and its maintenance.\n\nAnother advantage of decentralised applications is peer-to-peer communication. In other words, your app can communicate to its digital twin, the IoT service and the end-user application without a single point of signal decline, eliminating the need for third parties and intermediary resources when a task needs to be executed. This is what the [robonomics.js](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-js) is for, used in the development of [Dapp Robonomics](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/). We are currently in the process of adding a new iteration of improvements and will soon release a Robonomics Stylebook (an interface guide based on web3.js and polkadot.js functions), leaving you with an easy job of structuring your application right. As a result, we complete the full Economy of Robots chain.\n\n![Robonomics Network](./images/the-ultimate-guide-to-robonomics-rws-and-robonomics-parachain-on-polkadot/robonomics-network-2.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n* Our goal is to make [robots part of the economy](https://blog.aira.life/the-first-in-the-economy-of-robots-6f4bb115643b) but first, we need to teach the user on how everything works and set up.\n* To aid the purpose, we have created the [Robonomics Web Services](https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-web-services-and-rws-token-intro-d730ab50ad42) product that allows users to build apps and services together with us (subscription, launch, datalog).\n* Subscription to RWS resolves all transaction-related issues and adds functions that include: turning device on/off, telemetry (storage of a digital twin).\n* Once you create a digital twin via in-house templates, you can develop an IoT service and add it to our [marketplace](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services). The pre-structured interfaces in Dapp are used as a delivery mechanism that take your service to the end-user.\n* [Dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/) serves as a bulletproof way to establish a peer-to-peer (direct) communication with a digital twin, even when the service stops to operate. Regardless of the external circumstances, the market will never fail to work.\n* The aforementioned chain is a pathway to the Economy of Robots described in this article.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robonomics-logo.62c183a.55ad49b8c05f517a00fbc467115a9fba.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width:
