These use cases describe unique opportunities for the crypto audience and all participants of the IoT market.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\nOur team already has various business cases that are ready to leverage the parachain technology. But before we can roll out these use cases we need to obtain a parachain in the [Kusama Parachain Auctions](https://kusama.network/auctions/). So, let’s talk about each of these current use cases.\n\n## Meet Spot, our Robodog\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_xBLkszEwWk\n\nThis summer, the first group of engineers learned to work with our own Spot as part of the [spot-sdk.education](https://spot-sdk.education) course. By the end of September, anyone, anywhere in the world can take our course and get his hands on with the robodog from [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot). The course is developed by robotics specialists from the [ITMO University](https://en.itmo.ru/) in St. Petersburg and [Merklebot](https://merklebot.com/) acting as the local operator in the San Francisco Bay Area lab, the home of our Spot. \n\nAccessing Spot is organized through the use of two parachains - the Robonomics and Statemine parachains. Logs of the students passing the course will be recorded on the Robonomics Parachain where the [Statemine parachain](https://polkadot.network/statemine-upgrade-launches-new-phase-of-parachain-functionality/) is being used to replace user accounts with unique access tokens that students will receive after payment of their course.\n\n## An Urban Sensor Network on the Volga river\n\nOne experiment that is leveraging the power of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/) based Blockchain technologies is currently taking place in Tolyatti. The focus here is creating an alarm network detecting high levels of air pollution without a commercial focus and being dependent on a government, but solely being supported by the citizens of Tolyatti and the Russian Airalab organization. The automatically collected information on exceeding the level of air pollution will be used for a quick response of the mobile laboratory, which is already capable of conducting a detailed analysis of particles in the air.\n\nAll data collected by the Urban Sensor Network will be securely recorded in the Robonomics parachain to avoid any possibility of intervention in the measurement history and provide security from disabling the network during attacks of the main server. \n\nIt is an example of the social impact the Robonomics project can have in these times where [90% of the world's population breathes dirty air](https://www.bloomberg.org/blog/accelerating-clean-air-action-one-data-point-at-a-time/). Thus, with the help of Kusama we can have a trustable, immutable way of storing pollution data which can be used for science to create a better world for all [protected against corrupted actors on both corporate and government level](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/06/05/corruption-is-a-threat-to-planet-earth/).\n\n<Card>\n\nWatch **a step-by-step process** of how to connect an SDS011 Air Quality Sensor to the Robonomics Decentalized Sensor Network from our Community member\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AQ7ZzgbN7jU\n\n</Card>\n\n## Digital Twins for Smart Leasing\n\nThere is an interesting new use case in Robonomics. For four months already, an industrial manipulator has been operating in a manufacturing facility in the United States with an hourly wage. At the end of each shift, the manipulator updates its digital twin instance stored in the parachain. Based on the changes in the digital twin, an invoice is issued for the use of the manipulator structured as IoT-enabled leasing. \n\nThus, we can say that Kusama will be an example of a fintech solution from web3 for the new industry 4.0. [Someday the public will understand the significance of this use case](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/manufacturing/us-supply-chain-of-the-autonomous-robots.pdf), and we will see a boom of DeFi for this modern industry!\n\n## Digital Passports for IoT systems\n\nTwo projects — one is from New Zealand — are using parachains for recording data about production manufacturing. In one case, data about the content of substances in the ground on farms is collected, in the second — data about the final assembling of medical equipment. \n\nBoth scenarios would help the Kusama network to expose itself as a registry for global production distributors.\n\n<Card>\n\n**Project 1** New Zealand’s premier industry is considered to be Agriculture. Climate change and clean water in our rivers are also at the forefront of New Zealand’s concerns. Luckily, with the advances in precision agriculture and the efficiency of our world-leading practices, our sheep and beef farmers can claim to produce less Greenhouse Gas Emissions to get a piece of meat to a dinner table in London than the comparable farmers in Wales:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGMeYKInAk\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n**Project 2** Demonstration of the work of an automated workstation for video recording of the assembly process and testing of complex technical products.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wmeBIbNaBlQ\n\n</Card>\n\n## Second Wave of Kusama Crowdloans\n\nWe would love to see your support for [Robonomics during its crowdloan](https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot/) for the 6-10th parachain slot on the Kusama network so we can implement each use case as soon as possible!\n\nWhile these use cases are just scratching the surface of the potential that the Robonomics Network will bring to the industry 4.0 after obtaining a parachain slot on [Kusama](https://kusama.network/), they demonstrate the numerous capabilities of Web3 that are not yet being explored or utilized. \n\n*This is only the beginning of Robonomics' Web3 journey, and ultimately we plan to enable millions of interoperable IoT devices in the Polkadot ecosystem, including many of which have not yet been conceived, but are already possible with [the technology of Robonomics](https://blog.aira.life/a-brief-introduction-to-robonomics-9b7884172e77)!*\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-future.png'\">\n\n### Want to be a part of the future?\n\nHead over to the [Robonomics Crowdloan page](https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot/) or the [Kusama Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/parachains/crowdloan) and support us building the infrastructure for the Smart Robotic grid of tomorrow!🦾\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-2eeab5788dceda9365a51bc1b0cc047e'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-2eeab5788dceda9365a51bc1b0cc047e)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQYEBwACAwj/xAAyEAABBAECBAMGBQUAAAAAAAABAgMEEQUAEgYhMUEHEyIUFUJRcYEWMmGR8CMzobHB/8QAGwEAAQQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAIDBQcAAQb/xAAtEQACAQMCBAQFBQAAAAAAAAABAhEAAwQhMQUSQVETcYGRBiIjMkJhwdHh8P/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AS8LiW8s6zEYfCJ7zu1KXPS2EBJJJV1u%2bgA1AkRjGlusOlKi2soUUGwSDXI/LUiBDdnT2orHlpUsi1LUQEjqVH9AASfpo9wX%2bH2%2bOWoWZPvLGLaWCQ0tI3V6SnYdx9QquXXmBrpHygkyek1ZmVmWcZ2VmLTpyga7kEgmJE6d5pahtMLfCZK1IbPcaFZrJw8USHVlaz/bbSLUodvpq8lOeHKFqS41jQpJoj2ebyPf4/nrk214VJQVKh43ziQveliYPVfW916HbPYj5FPtTF7iF5l%2bjj3AT1KTHpP71XfB0KJkMJIl5VlLLqCkuJU6QW2ylRtAH5lirogj97AuLGQ8shx9tkCua7/5q4EveGYCfMZg7t1qpiZW2u3q660D/AIa7k2zjtvf%2bjNv7erWLnMNwfat2811mbF07fj/fWqnVEYbksJclIUytQ8xbYJKBfPl9Nc5zTDct1MRxTkcKpC1CiRo7xmzj3M9kH%2bFmFJxFj2YqQvaPSLvdzrdel2K2%2bmOgStvn/HtNi77HRK5BME1I2AL11Ss/bqNIBkaN1DDt51P4Eh5XKcXY9uIhsuoUp9e/8pQ2CtQPaqFffVzcaeGOLx%2bNhT8PKgYh8zG9r0te1K0q5%2bWlXRNUSLu67aXODGE4rOtrYAPtCFRVgj4Viv3BAP21ZviniY8nw%2bY3Kdpt5ohKllQvmOh5d9I4n4VziFrHiIAO06GRVR2s/IIa%2bLhnz7a15%2b4kW1M4my8x7KRmIK5jiIuxsuuvISqtwSOiaF7jV60jFiAhWTjTo0tDBLQZl48qS64UWBsJFgXZV0HLrou5w/FcNq%2bVch/n6jWK4fjKUlW9e4UAf9/v30SOCheVUuEKsCAEjlAiNVJk9TPfQUQPiTK8LwS5iI3P8xHpQ3C5H8ScQRmMvExsIbFpjtxI/s7ch815bbiwTsSo8t1cr7XYBZKRk25slqbGYjSG1llxpDIHlqT6Smge1deZPz07xsUzGktPt15jS0uJ3JsWDYsfbW8/HonTZMp/b5shxTy9qaG5Rs0O3M6lFxLCvIQRFDLx7NRAqXmEfqaScbkc1IbXjhNZYiqHpDidqau1XV/qa/TUfLyMlCeajMjHykoSCX2UEAg8%2bvc8/lp39yx/4NZ7lj/waS%2bFZe5zMJWNv9r6bU2vGMhVZVcjmMmNJJ3JiJJ7nWv/2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Second Robonomics Crowdloan campaign","path":"/blog/kusama-crowdloan-second-wave-details/","date":"August 20, 2021","description":"The second wave of auctions in the Kusama network will start on September 01, 2021. Robonomics will participate in the slot auction starting from the first day of the second wave. Take a look at details","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\nThis is great news indeed! There were many concerns that the successful connection of the first 5 parachains would shift the focus of the entire community and developers to replicating already tried mechanisms in the Polkadot network. But no! Not long after, and you can see how the Kusama network is deciding to hold a second wave of auctions. The Robonomics team is pleased with this news, and we will try to get into the list of projects that can say with confidence they are part of the Polkadot ecosystem in September.\n\nBelow you will find the final parameters of the second crowdloan of the Robonomics company, and the answers to the most interesting questions that we, as the project developers, have tried to proactively highlight.\n\n## From the past to the present\n\nDuring the first auctions of the Kusama network, Robonomics published a crowdloan module for the start of the 3rd auction. It was necessary to try to guess the sufficient fundraising limit. As a result, it was decided to set a collection limit of 135,000 KSM. If you look at the results of auctions from the 3rd to the 5th, then the limit was chosen, we can say with pinpoint accuracy:\n\n![An Overview of the First Five Parachain Slot Auctions on Kusama](./images/kusama-crowdloan-second-wave-details/auctions-on-kusama-overview.png)\n*Source: Making History: [An Overview of the First Five Parachain Slot Auctions on Kusama](https://polkadot.network/making-history-an-overview-of-the-first-five-parachain-slot-auctions-on-kusama/)*\n\nAlso, as can be seen from the statistics of the last Robonomics crowdloan company, about ~ 27,000 KSM were collected in total. Among the projects that participated in the first wave of auctions, such a volume allowed the project to be on the 7th line, i.e. become the second project among those who did not receive a slot in the first wave. In general, we are confident that the second wave of auctions should be successful not only for the Kusama chain, but also for us personally. In general, in order to successfully pass the second wave of auctions, we want to do the main thing - not to change the conditions of participation…\n\n## 2nd Robonomics Crowdloan parameters\n\nRobonomics Developers will publish the KSM crowdloan module on August 30 with the following parameters:\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside grid-3\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n<Card>\n\nRobonomics Parathread ID = 2077\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\nThe start of the crowdloan company - from the 6th auction of the Kusama network.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\nCrowdloan limit - 135,000 KSM\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\nFor each KSM bonded, you’ll get 3.5 XRT on the horizon of 48 weeks\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n1.725 XRT will be unlocked within the first month after the Robonomics parachain launch\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\nKSM bonders will get the entire reward in one year of XRT staking with an increased APR of up to 100%\n\n</Card>\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n<Card>\n\nAll members of the crowdloan company will receive a Robonomics Pioneer NFT card.

By mid-September, we will have to finish checking the functionality of the update 1.1 Staking and 1.2 Treasury and Technical committee updates of the [Frontier network](/blog/robonomics-frontier/), which in turn will significantly reduce the time to implement these updates after the launch in Kusama. Also, all balances of parachain users in the Frontier network will be transferred to the Robonomics parachain managed by Kusama ASAP.\n\nThus, the updated roadmap for the development of the Robonomics parachain for the period of slot leasing will look like this:\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 1: Establishing core functionality\n\nIn 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n* **Genesis state: (0 week)** Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.\n* **Update 1.1** Staking and allowing transfers (0 - 1 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for all token holders and 50% for Crowdloan participants.\n* **Update 1.2** Treasury and Technical committee (2 - 3 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n* **Update 1.3** RWS (4 - 5 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n* **Update 1.4** Robot-as-a-service (6 - 7 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n* **Update 1.5** XCMP functionality and Robobank (8 - 9 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n* **Update 1.6** Democracy and Remove Sudo (10 - 11 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D\n\n2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.\n\n* **Globally available digital passports of products**. By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.\n* **Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics**. We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries. The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n* **Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits**. It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n* **Fault-tolerant civil sensors network**. A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.\n* **Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas**. It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n* **Ecosystem integration updates**. We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain. This is our vision of the future of Robonomics, as a complete segment of the Polkadot infrastructure specifically prepared for working with IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\n## In conclusion\n\nKusama is an experimental network, and the main thing for which it is worth participating in any activity around this network is the desire to be involved in a large experiment. When deciding whether you will help Robonomics during the second crowdloan company or not, the only significant question for you should be - do I want to see the functionality of connecting IoT devices from the real world under the control of the Kusama network in the near future? If you answer is yes, then you are as crazy as we are - you want to turn the world around, which means you are welcome on board!\n\n<!-- > Stay tuned and follow our updates [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) -->\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-notification.png'\" :link=\"'https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics'\">\n\n### Join our Twitter\n\nStay tuned and follow updates\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.c6e7484481c1104ca1a5fc0088afa978.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.c6e7484481c1104ca1a5fc0088afa978.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.c6e7484481c1104ca1a5fc0088afa978.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.c6e7484481c1104ca1a5fc0088afa978.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-93ccb84084d94c317c2dec4c102550b3'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-93ccb84084d94c317c2dec4c102550b3)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2brMiuKBeW1xq7pGUI3jQVX3X4eYJlSOWOZMhZASPT2I1Gres1nVsUz5C7FBf5cYHcd/f19dbI1OoDqRscn5fwo5DkrYcItJ5HBHIPUZLv1TTVCyCWuhp2HYOrsW/1B0IflKRiu66U65ZgcxycAZwfp7HA/wA6K%2boehb1F0t%2bpJVt4pUC%2bbFTyEvGGIwWByP5hnB4zoLobdXXFnW30dTVFMFvJjL7c9s40Z6Y0EUhX8xxCjoZaGk2PHCfonpWgvtwrFrrrHFQ0wXDx/I0zHsF3jjseSNWnib4eUvTNjt16s9bPU2%2brYRstQq70Ygkcjgjgj9tRPCro6m6oqrpLdK6ppKG2RpJNHCPnkLMVAye3Ix29dNbruwfqHoyisVjpJ4ZqEqY4qx9paIIwDA9iQ23P2J1Lvdpani2hKjRAJA2Fi9z1HFkfXYjCd53cjStzngev556ZnOwXP4bcFmdS0TApIo7lToogW1kib4vup8AeU5w23H0n19tAQ1Ih7jQGFqcVRNXj%2bNNDSA242lYBsar2J54I2NCwbGEd%2buS3OrXyAfJjG1MjGfc6qJQVB3AjjVhYYllrFD8jRvNYKSopgrAjcMZA5GnjkhMZoNp4zFLlrkPqeeNqVjot/QBpvCWnt9WkUdsudIs5ZZWaWCVkEmWJ4bOPTAGMffWVLVcqm11sVVSOBJGdwDcqf7j1763r4l0JovC65x0szL8OtMzxswzuKQlRn9tefo7amo7neIV58%2b/tg2mtAIux55sP8M3VVX1tbL%2bl5obZ/BNTYkhpwjysdzZfnBwUBH3J01PECOI2uCdlHmxyEKT3AKnI/wCDWf8A8IMkkFj61mibDK9HjjP9TR94y9X1to6GqLmYoqiSCRIkQ5UZkyu449u%2bNIVTY8Oe3ASCL4rj3thFt6klWf/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Tech AMA [Robonomics frontier network, XRT staking, Kusama crowdloan rewards]","path":"/blog/ama-2021-08-04/","date":"August 4, 2021","description":"On Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Robonomics Software Architect Sergei Lonshakov hosted a tech AMA in the Robonomics telegram community.

Before the next wave of auctions, the project’s developers decided to deploy and maintain a functionally identical network.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Not a wild cousin of Kusama\n\nKusama Relay chain is under development and passes all updates using stable versions of Polkadot releases. For example, the current version of Kusama was built on [polkadot v0.9.8](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.8) release.\n\n![Kusama Relay Chain and Polkadot release 0.9.8](./images/Robonomics-Frontier/Kusama-Relay-Chain-and-Polkadot-release-0-9-8.jpg)\n\nFrontier Relay chain will use the same versions of Polkadot releases, which will be implemented by Kusama network in the form of its Relay chain.\n\nTo connect to Frontier Relay chain, you can use Substrate portal following this link: https://parachain.robonomics.network/ \n\nAfter connecting the Robonomics parachain to the Frontier Relay chain we can have a blockchain that could work in real-time and would be integrated into the Kusama network. It means that we need to overcome any challenges that Kusama parachains will have. All new capabilities that will appear with new Polkadot releases, will be also supported by Robonomics’ parachain.\n\n## XCMP and integration with Kusama parachains\n\nMaybe only one disadvantage today (in 2021), when we are talking about the lifecycle in a Frontier network and not about the main Kusama network, is a lack of integration via [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain#overview-of-xcmp).\n\nBut it does not mean that you cannot execute technical integration tasks and prepare a Robonomics parachain to work with Karura, Moonriver and Khala. It is those three parachains that are interesting for the Robonomics team in terms of integration. We can start maintaining work in a Frontier network with copies of the mentioned projects, but only after release of public documentation and first samples of using Kusama (how to create trading pair on Karura, connect functions of parachain with solidity/ink smart contracts in Moonriver, or to provide data privacy with Khala).\n\nI’m personally expecting that the process of parachains integration would be executed very carefully in the first year, and maybe other projects will also work together in sandboxes and after it transfer integration mechanisms to Kusama network. So, Robonomics could be in the Kusama network right to the moment of active integration between the projects.\n\n## Genesis block of Robonomics parachain in Frontier network\n\nIn the genesis block will be presented XRT balances of exodus participants, crowdloan contributors and open test network collators. This block will be formed only a few days before the parachain launch in a Frontier network. We will announce this update on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) and [Telegram](https://t.me/Robonomics_ann).\n\nWe are expecting that the genesis block will be formed during the period from 28th to 31st of July.\n\nImportant information for XRT holders in the Ethereum network: To participate in the parachain’s genesis block and participate in staking, you can use dapp exodus till 28th of July. After 28th of July the opportunity to transfer XRT tokens into Ethereum to Frontier will still be available. But this process will be executed by the technical committee of the network and not more often than once a week.\n\nAlso we would like to notice, that the exodus would not allow you to go back till the moment when Robonomics parachain will be connected to the Kusama network, and when there will be suitable bridge to Ethereum. The situation is ~ similar to the process of transfer to Ethereum 2.0 for ETH holders.\n\n## XRT staking\n\nXRT staking in Robonomics parachain aims to split the capacity between two options of payments: for transaction or for subscription. You can read more about this in the article [“RWS overview, part 2 “Heterogeneous tokenomics”](https://blog.aira.life/rws-overview-part-2-heterogeneous-tokenomics-afc209cc855) on Medium.\n\nThe basis of reward for the staking will be ~ 10%. This amount helps to launch the parachain. In the future, the reward will be determined by [Democracy pallet](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/pallet_democracy/) for XRT holders. \n\nCrowdloan contributors will get increased reward rate — 50%. Thus, it will help us to test the mechanism: “Parachain, which always wins”, which will propose adaptive reward for staking Robonomics to the reward for staking in Kusama / Polkadot relay chain and considering XRT price to KSM/DOT. We will explain later in detail about this mechanism and after a few tests. \n\nStaking will be available from the update 1.1 in Frontier network. Please note that tokens transfer in parachain will be turned off on the start, similar to the launch of the Polkadot Relay chain.\n\n## Roadmap - Life after auction\n\nRegardless of that we did not win a slot — the roadmap of parachain development won’t change. Below you will find our plans that were published in the article: https://robonomics.network/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/.\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 1: Establishing core functionality\n\nIn 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n* **Genesis state: (0 week)** Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.\n* **Update 1.1** Staking and allowing transfers (3 - 4 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for all token holders and 50% for Crowdloan participants.\n* **Update 1.2** Treasury and Technical committee (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n* **Update 1.3** RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n* **Update 1.4** Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n* **Update 1.5** XCMP functionality and Robobank (11 - 12 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n* **Update 1.6** Democracy and Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D\n\n2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.\n\n* **Globally available digital passports of products** By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.\n* **Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics** We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries. The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n* **Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits** It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n* **Fault-tolerant civil sensors network** A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.\n* **Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas** It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n* **Ecosystem integration updates** We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain.

For four years, in parallel with the Parity developers, we studied the future network architecture, tried early developments of the Substrate framework and prepared the Robonomics parachain for launch with one goal - to create a vertical in the Polkadot ecosystem that will be machine-friendly.\n\nRobonomics team consists of robotics engineers, academic researchers, and software developers. We are one of the few who have been studying the possibilities of Bitcoin, Ethereum, IPFS and Polkadot for communication between people and automated services connected to the Internet for seven years. We want to see smart cities of the future today, but we don't wish these cities of the future to be smart concentration camps for people watching you and can get access to your house, car, or pacemaker without your permission. \n\nI am sure that the only alternative for total control is the p2p economically significant interaction, so the IoT platform we are developing is called Robonomics.\n\nBy winning a parachain slot in the Kusama network, we will open the doors for hundreds of IoT developers to the Polkadot ecosystem and help them take their first steps under the guidance of experienced teachers and roboticists. Most IoT developers we interviewed are happy to try an alternative to the usual corporate clouds, but it simply does not exist today. Almost every engineer we know understands the problems associated with client-server solutions. However, today there is still no environment that a corporation does not manage and at the same time produces user’s trust.\n\nPolkadot is a trust-free ecosystem, and Robonomics is a way to connect smart devices under its control. Contribute to its development. We offer up to 5 XRT per 1 KSM to early supporters who bonds the first 35,000 KSM. The proposed reward makes Robonomics Crowdloan more profitable than stacking in Kusama Relay Chain at the current rate by more than two times.\n\nWe’ll announce the launch of the Robonomics Crowdloan campaign on [the Robonomics Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) account in the coming hours.\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Read the terms of participating in the Robonomics crowdloan campaign in the blog:\n\n[https://robonomics.network/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/](/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Participate in the crowdloan through the dedicated page:\n\n[https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot](/kusama-slot)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### You can also always use the standard interfaces from parity:\n\n[https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\" imageSize=\"big\">\n\n### Welcome to our journey!\n\nEnsRationis\n\nRobonomics network architect\n\nelement: @ensrationis:robonomics.network\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.62c183a.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.9ea8d39.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg 480w","/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.6b2ed88.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.62c183a.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-822c560b1b2911897138f1c4e3d4588c'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-822c560b1b2911897138f1c4e3d4588c)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bjdmieJcY4vIpPyAsFfTKGbrCu74cyOq0hTtEbX2QEKBXb4I3xoj%2bDctxxRk1FDbajcFhhS7fFjb43w5ZmkUqiswqjXZCxIjp/G0kjW8tIvYDuR92%2bcN816LIiw5DtTkRQ7HQ4mOHencFB3uPu/2kYhOmcuwi5R8TY1Nlc1SsqToco13HpvEge8G5Ta0Ki1FLoSQVCRHUj/AFte/wB45pmUU051xmQaY4tDQU4W4rznRSeFrKU2Twefu2LVRmYxlmS1VJjhAc/TLkFxFrD97WuPa5xPIdXFXqa52WHQtl5r9QXgv0OqKWknpgXNkoJ3sLEm%2bGkzOZrF6Vj2KLczJjpA1YAPsCWLPdrawqycnRaeCZNQy8Soa0tqWoqIIuNI5N%2b2EWLlee9OW/MqUSJS2wCgtNuPF0kketQTpTba4B7jc4Za5m2gQqgVRKfLnwIqURVykSVtB3QkIJSE2uLC19wcUzLNNyxV6XAqVBpcSXAkC6HFpKygg7pIUTYg3vgvQ7GDL4lmSJYUuatRt/PLFxdjckdiA%2b4gp/MVTjeFjtUP46m2rQVoRrF9QGq3192wvzcyT2W489yZ5gN3BbShKgq/cHm4IFvs4WH6tOj1x2AmW/8Aw9toyBG1%2bjWEagbfYvjrjIU29ESlw6g0Ooq39QK3sRxtbb2/9VPSVUoeMEq6s4Pm2tulvW8c6mVKFoSCSCw7eo%2b9oy6qZmaiPuVRtLb8tZLesW6beoaQB7gX/fFRertFp%2biDPeS3IZhlaGUunWplHfTcf48/B9jhBUTcWt6bkbY1Vqd52VHEiNGU88lcVT/T/IGlIOpIV2BxTxijrZ02RMpFDIkHM%2b7s1vfRo0aLEkKzy1hgpTpSNATY/AF30ii0ip06XCam0tDihIbJCnH1LsDsbeog8cjEqy7FXRoUhEeI01OacUkrK7B5B3BUeR6VEDnjjBCgTXqMXKZD0%2bVist9HqDUpIJVcE9998FKfl2PXI8iQ5IksOxSFt9JQtfcm9xzt77YFh8qpoZlRUVy/CJ/RtgM2o7d/iJVlWZmWlpg51UCWBZiPvnHnRjLVWjU9%2bLIulMtd4%2blCnA/vYWWBpPvyLYsnhfVallXJMKkClNPOBDrrakv3GorJ9Xxa3HJB39gvibJLDUOmR20NQ0krShN9tOwH/ScMuQcvJmZDcr70t/zDAUy00LaAlBAsffb6tg%2bGVgq6ZNTPTa%2bUbm9ul%2b5aHxIugS6dDKd1F/LVi/sI/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Crowdloan final parameters and 48 weeks roadmap","path":"/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/","date":"June 28, 2021","description":"Robonomics Developers publish the KSM crowdloan module on June 28th.

It’ll allow competing for the 3rd slot.** At the moment, PLO auction participants bid around 25,000 - 30,000 KSM for the 5th slot\n* **For each KSM bonded, you’ll get 3.5 XRT on the horizon of 48 weeks.** Based on the current XRT and KSM price, Robonomics crowdloan offer outperforms Kusama Relay Chain staking by x1.5\n* **1.725 XRT will be unlocked within the first month** after the Robonomics parachain launch\n* **KSM bonders will get the entire reward in one year of XRT staking** with an increased APR of up to 100%\n* **Distribution of the crowdloan rewards will happen in Robonomics parachain. There won’t be an option to get rewards in ERC-20 XRT**\n\n## Bonuses\n\n* **Robonomics crowdloan won’t provide any referral bonuses**\n* **Increased reward for the first 35,000 KSM collected.** Get 5 XRT instead of 3,5 in one year\n* **Extra reward for [Robonomics Polkapet NFT](https://opensea.io/assets/0x8cb813bf27dc744fc5fb6ba7515504de45d39e08/24) holders, who’ll bond the first 35,000 KSM.** Get 6 XRT instead of 3,5 XRT in one year.\n\n## Most important to know\n\nRobonomics developers are early adopters of Polkadot. We understand that the current technical implementation of the Kusama Relay Chain and Substrate framework may contain errors and be reviewed this or next year. The participants of the crowdloan campaign need to keep that in mind.\n\nBesides, the entire Polkadot ecosystem is establishing now, this process may take an indefinite time. Don’t forget this whenever studying any plans of developers.\n\nThis is a grand experiment, ladies and gentlemen.\nYou want to participate in it at your own risk.\n\nWelcome to our journey!\n\n## Roadmap - Life after auction\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Part 1: Establishing core functionality\n\nIn 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n* Genesis state: (0 week). Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.\n* Update 1.1: Staking and allowing transfers (3 - 4 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for token holders and 100% for Crowdloan participants.\n* Update 1.2: Treasury and Technical committee (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n* Update 1.3: RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n* Update 1.4: Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n* Update 1.5: XCMP functionality and Robobank (11 - 12 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n* Update 1.6: Democracy and Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D\n\n2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.\n\n* Globally available digital passports of products. By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.\n* Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics. We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries.  The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n* Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits. It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n* Fault-tolerant civil sensors network. A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.\n* Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas. It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n* Ecosystem integration updates. We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain.

Becoming one of Kusama's parachains is a good way to provide access to your Substrate project within the Polkadot ecosystem, implement currently unavailable Blockchain network security to small projects, as well as initiate the integration process with other ecosystem projects as soon as possible. The goal of Robonomics for 2022 is to become a fully functioning conductor of IoT projects to the Polkadot ecosystem. This is why all of the aforementioned benefits of launching a Kusama network are important to us. And in general, our strategy has [already been published](/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/) a long time ago - \"Kusama first, while Polkadot is a vision\". In this post, we’ll dissect the use of the Cowdloan module in detail and take a look at the parachain update plan after launching. \n\n## Kusama crowdloans have started!\n\n*Dr. Gavin Wood, June 8, 2021, [Kusama Parachain Auctions](https://polkadot.network/kusama-parachain-auctions/):*\n\n> The following is the case assuming that no significant and unexpected issues are found with the relay-chain logic. (In such a case, all options should remain on the table for network governance, including pausing or postponing any scheduled or ongoing auctions.)\n\n**Preliminary schedule of auctions:**\n\n- 2021/06/15, 12:00 GMT: First Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences. Bids may be placed.\n\n- 2021/06/22, 12:00 GMT: Second Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/06/29, 12:00 GMT: Third Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/07/06, 12:00 GMT: Fourth Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/07/13, 12:00 GMT: Fifth Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\nPolkadot allows parachains to source tokens for their parachain bids in a decentralized [crowdloan](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crowdloans). Once a crowdloan campaign is open, anyone can participate by sending a special transaction that references the campaign's index. Tokens used to participate must be transferable — that is, not locked for any reason, including staking, vesting, and governance — because they will be moved into a module-controlled account that was generated uniquely for this campaign.\n\nFour projects who launched their KSM crowdloan campaigns (Kurara up to 1,5 mln KSM, Shiden up to 1 mln KSM, Crust up to 1 mln KSM, Moonriver up to 1 mln KSM)  to collect resources for leasing the parachain slot on Kusama during the parachain lease offering auctions. \n\nRobonomics Dev DAO aims to bid an exact amount of KSM needed for securing a third-fifth parachain slot. Thus, the crowdloan module will be launched right after the end of the auction for 2nd slot on Kusama.\n\n## Estimated time of the Robonomics crowdloan launch is 28 June\n\nYou’ll be able to participate in the Robonomics crowdloan through the [dedicated page](/kusama-slot).\n\n**Before participating in the crowdloan, double-check that the campaign is live [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).**\n\n## How to participate in the Robonomics Crowdloan \n\nBy default, Polkadot developers provided a native interface in the [Substrate portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan)\n\n![Crowdloan on Polkadot portal](./images/kusama-crowdloan-details/crowdloan-on-polkadot-portal.png)\n*Example of the Crowdloan page on June 11th, 2021*\n\nAt the start of April, Robonomics practised participating in auctions by using the Crowdloan module on the Rococo network. You can check out this Twitter thread to familiarize yourself with the standard interface for community participation in [Polkadot auctions](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1377653645827833860)\n\nAlso, it’s worth mentioning that on the official [Robonomics site](/kusama-slot), functionality for interacting with the Crowdloan module will be made available.\n\n![How to participate in Robonomics Crowdloan on Kusama](./images/kusama-crowdloan-details/crowdloan2.gif)\nThis is what Crowdloan participation will look like on the Robonomics site after June 28th. \n\nInstructions on how to use the Crowdloan interface module through the Robonomics website will be published closer to the start of the third auction. \n\n## Popular questions amongst the community\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Why does Robonomics participation start only from the third round?\n\nDevelopers could publish the Crowdloan module today, but then we would have to implement limits. As can be noticed, the first 4 projects that published their Crowdloan modules established a 1 million KSM token limit. \n\nWe’re placing our bets on 100,000 KSM being enough to win one of the Kusama network auctions, but are also reserving space for ourselves to quickly adjust the limit if we come to understand that more KSM tokens will need to be collected by the conclusion of the first and second rounds. In general, we’re trying to manoeuvre in search of an optimal rental cost for a slot.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### What will happen if Robonomics doesn’t win the 5th auction? \n\nTo be honest, we don’t have a plan B. [We'll be like Schwarzenegger](https://youtu.be/Ri-M_Vo3w5A).\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Will it be possible to participate in the Robonomics crowdloan through exchanges? \n\nSome well-known exchanges like Kraken and Okex are already providing crowdloan support for their users. A list of relevant exchanges that support interaction with the Crowdloan module will be provided on the Robonomics website at the start of the 3rd auction.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### What will happen in 48?\n\nIf after 48 weeks the project will once again be unsuccessful in winning an auction, then the parachain will turn into a [parathread](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parathreads#docsNav). However, developers have already published preparation plans for future slot auctions: here’s a publication from October 26th, 2020, [Robonomics Parachain Lease Offering, On-chain Governance Strategy](/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/). But, we also have a secret plan concerning the development of an algorithm to be built into the Robonomics protocol, which will autonomously generate beneficial bonding terms for KSM/DOT holders that will also benefit Robonomics. In general, we contemplate over medium-term issues in advance and continue to think about important matters such as maintaining Robobomics in the state of a parachain today.\n\n</Card>\n\n## Life after auctions\n\nA parachain comes to life inseparably from the moment auction results are concluded. But for a project, this doesn’t indicate that work is over. Remember how the Polkadot Relay Chain launched? The Robonomics team is contemplating over an analogous launch form, increasing functionality accessible to a user in steps. \n\n## Robonomics will start its existence with the following possibilities: \n\n- XRT transfers between balances\n\n- Launch of IoT devices using XRT for paying transaction fees \n\n- Sending IoT device telemetry using XRT for paying transaction fees \n\n- Sudo\n\n- A technical committee\n\n## Further update plan\n\n- Genesis state: Core functionality (0 week). Launch of the above set of functions.\n\n- Update 0.1: Staking (1 - 3 week). Will allow you to stake your XRT with a 10% APY for token holders and 125% for Crowdloan participants. \n\n- Update 0.2: Treasury (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. \n\n- Update 0.3: RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments but a monthly subscription as well. \n\n- Update 0.4: Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices. \n\n- Update 0.5: Robobank (11 - 12 week). You can read about Robonomics in this article:\nhttps://robonomics.network/blog/robobank-introduction/ \n\n- Update 0.6: Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee. \n\n- Ecosystem integration updates (before the end of the year). Further, we will focus attention on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in what Polkadot can do. \n\nStay tuned and follow our updates [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics)\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.62c183a.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.9ea8d39.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.6b2ed88.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.62c183a.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-7a089b301d1ba104aa2078919dfee8ba'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-7a089b301d1ba104aa2078919dfee8ba)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUCAwYH/8QALxAAAgIBAwEHAgUFAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABSESBhMiMUFRcQcUFTJhkaGBkrHB0f/EABkBAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGAgMEAP/EACoRAAEDAgQEBwEBAAAAAAAAAAECAxEABBIhMUEFE3HwBiJRYYGRocHR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDEQV4pKsrtIwlUqQqgEBc4JYn%2bAM6ruxRQWpI4J1sRKcCVRgNxqq5NBUjV5omkDOECowDEn2JB%2bPI/B1XbFpNxh6ak0VOXIZ5kKxo3TkKjEAs3B4P7DTsviqGbsNqUYVsY3jTcxB%2bzrlWVHDS5bqemMHoJn9megI9YqeD7abV9jndI5JiEVsEp5tjQe20LO4Qd5XjkdhjrRIJZChPoelTz66fxRbtFWji%2bztzPnHeCvOCB/aPn340TXeNpMYqBXSH8A5PfSk12iIbE4LGML1FVZTkkH8v6f60A6MjFXUqw8wRgjTtKe6XIla1Qtwu%2bfFNXnYjj36efL%2bdLLtG5UryTW4pIVGQhlhlXvCBnAJXGTqSbxomMWfelWNIcCfP31oUjnzOibVC1USN7MMkQf8vXwT6%2bXnqW0Vd4v/cNsdeaYJCe/wC7QHpU%2bec/H8aUTWbTESTSSMWGAz85x%2bp1ILUXSmRA98/rb9rRhGGc5/K652U7J2fwala3GnGtS0VtrYOCzKMgIpByrcgjy9fPSmnYil7SNt1WFtygMrRVYpj1ksVwABwMZz6Z/X108%2bm/aiXdaY7N3qytDBWYRzxuUcIMDHz4vzDGtNt3ZXZNuu171CpJFagkVkdpmfnPng6Q%2bI267W9dvruClI8oA0AznXX6rc1cuBg2zTh8%2bvz8bVzWXcN/%2bn%2b7W9tiKVpxMk7K6LJyFPQQfhiPbU63bve5ZO7laoDKAvNZQGHoB7as%2brO4S7n2wtzT9IaNFqjpHsgYN85bWc2eGvYuH7xHesis7xxuELLkZUMQcDy9Doq3fWNyyi5WwFKUATIG4HXvemGx8JXl6wXebgRsdSfeBA16Vp9x7eb7AxqJNXbuy%2bFFdT055Yn9s6Sbv2s3feqiVbksJhjl79VjgVfH09OT/Q6I3OpVvSz260Ipws5RII2JCL1dJ8R5JOMk%2bpzpd9jGNzaDqboUDkAA%2bI/4GdXWjvDyoAsJSroP8rrrwveWTXODuNKczsR/DHselANuN6vFKsE7Rd7w5i8HUPY4xnSlkklcFizgccn01p7u2xRnpDufB1c49/jQW40EpRxNG7N3hOQccYx/3R9htlvJtIE%2bgpXuVqUZKpr/2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Kusama Parachain Lease Offering, April 2021","path":"/blog/kusama-parachain-auction/","date":"April 17, 2021","description":"Robonomics rewards the Kusama Parachain auction participants!","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\nimport Button from '~/components/Button.vue'\n\n<div class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## 1 KSM = 1 XRT\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"text_abstract layout layout__text animate post_abstract in-viewport animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\nEvery participant will be rewarded with XRT\n\n</div>\n\n> The most relevant information is available here: https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot\n\n- Get rewards: per 1 KSM contributed, 1 XRT is rewarded\n- XRT for now is available on Uniswap, Huobi, and in addition on PancakeSwap\n- Receive increased staking of 125% return for the next 48 weeks\n- Quick rewards option: 25% right after the win, 75% after the successful launch of the Robonomics parachain (est. 2-4 weeks)\n- Contribute to the future: Robonomics integrates new technologies into the real economy \n\nCrowdloan limit: 100,000 KSM\n\nRobonomics will participate in 3rd-5th slot auctions to win.

For example, it allows Polkadot users to [pay vending machines or robots in any token of the Polkadot ecosystem](https://robonomics.network/blog/robobank-introduction/).\n\nRobonomics is a project with a long history that started in 2015, after the launch of the Ethereum network. During the project’s development, the team published more than [10 academic articles](https://robonomics.network/community#science) and created more than [15 R&D projects](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/r-and-d-based-on-robonomics-network/) which included control of drones, industrial manipulators, sensor networks, and even a Boston Dynamics’ robot dog over Ethereum and Polkadot networks.\n\nRobonomics is a project that integrates new technologies into the real economy. However, to fuel this, a reasonable ‘gas’ price is required. Kusama makes the costs of communication between IoT devices and humans affordable.\n\nKusama Auction mechanics: [https://kusama.network/auctions](https://kusama.network/auctions)\n\nParachain Crowdloans: [https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/mirror-learn-crowdloans](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/mirror-learn-crowdloans)\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n![\"Robomomics Parachain on Kusama wallpaper\"](./images/Kusama-Parachain-auction/wallpaper_KUSAMA_6.jpg)\n\n</section>\n\n**Community, support our auction** 🦾\n\nRobonomics Developers DAO\n\nStay tuned: [https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics)\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.62c183a.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":676},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.9ea8d39.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 480w","/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.6b2ed88.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.62c183a.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 676' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-147d193177a363b1cc489fc0649b0a75'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-147d193177a363b1cc489fc0649b0a75)' width='1500' height='676' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2blXIqGSLODIpBIIBwDzxnU9v%2bwUG7tlXG03cyJTVCeuEZdGVgylQRyfMBx79tVv4U%2bHdr2BUXu81F3rL/dGolibqU3TEcDYYIFyc5wMnOAB7c6EuFcNdyi7oaS7mytu4Xqmoyg/KUuvnHTwR5fnOnUVUlRRJUU5yj4IJH38a4%2bzu252kkiFPTLTBYWkpX6kZ49I4HK/XsRrr6aBLfQJDDysYxlvfJ5Op0vrhORGxwMsdP73rfhNflZTS3qunJYBgpzk9uNCrEyup7DGONJgvUQscMM4Ge%2bkrkyuuB%2bONU0hZZgJEXHJzz8aYXusNrtdbXqvUMUfnCE4Bx96kCASCRyO2hqIY6iF4p0WSJxhlYZBH3rWEBwLhssNabKrJPFGsUqBZEKN/t1Wxj54XTGo8U5Up2hFko2ixjpiR8EfGOnjVnNtuyt6rXRH%2bYRrW21LA3qs1vP8wL%2btVNRIHwvX7SGsjDlypHbfif8A43b5aW32SIRSztMRJUyElm74xH2OMj6OlW/1CXGm6hbaatEneT%2b7YKR88pq6js7bZ72K2H/mT9aBtkbXYYbb1qI%2b6VP1o2zXZ45gnzPyjwxLlbNlXltzbWtF7eEU7VkAmMKt5gufbPGdTSsDI64wRjn50FFSU9DSRUtFDHBTRL5Y4o1Cqo%2bAB2GtoABJA5PfUmIWlxLRQWTAv//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}}]}}},"context":{}}
