In the future, we plan that commissions from the monthly subscription activations for digital twins of IoT systems will be accumulated on the On-Chain Treasury account (minus the commission of the collators and the further development fund). Funds from the treasury will be governed by the parachain technical committee for participation in the subsequent auctions of Kusama and Polkadot slots. Potentially, funds in the form of a 2-year commission should be sufficient enough to extend the slot lease after Robonomics transitions to the Relay Chain state.</p>\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Robonomics Parachain on Kusama</th>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Robonomics Relay chain on Polkadot</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>tps</td>\n            <td>1,500.00</td>\n            <td>tps</td>\n            <td>300,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>block time</td>\n            <td>6</td>\n            <td>block time</td>\n            <td>4</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>IoT Monthly subscriptions, max</td>\n            <td>9,000.00</td>\n            <td>IoT Monthly subscriptions, max</td>\n            <td>1,200,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Subscription price</td>\n            <td>$10.00</td>\n            <td>Subscription price</td>\n            <td>$2.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>2 years leasing slot total commissions</td>\n            <td>$2,160,000.00</td>\n            <td>2 years leasing slot total commissions</td>\n            <td>$57,600,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, %</td>\n            <td>2%</td>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, %</td>\n            <td>2%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, total</td>\n            <td>$43,200.00</td>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, total</td>\n            <td>$1,152,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Treasury</td>\n            <td>$2,116,800.00</td>\n            <td>Treasury</td>\n            <td>$56,448,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td></td>\n            <td></td>\n            <td>Robonomics Relay chain validators incentive</td>\n            <td>$15,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Commission rates for collators will be determined by the democracy module, as well as inflation rates after the launch of the Robonomics Relay Chain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ecosystem-strategy\"><a href=\"#ecosystem-strategy\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Ecosystem strategy</h2>\n<p>Robonomics is set to provide IoT devices with access to the Polkadot ecosystem, whilst Robonomics Parachains will store digital twins of these IoT devices. Within the parachain itself, users will be offered similar and even equivalent functions that are currently offered by other existing IoT cloud platforms such as AWS IoT, Azure IoT. In addition to standard IoT market functions implementations, for example, remote device launch and telemetry capture, Robonomics will be able to integrate with other projects in the eco-environment as they appear.</p>\n<p>We believe that within 2 years, the list of available Polkadot ecosystem opportunities for the IoT market will be as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Storage and management of cyber-physical systems’ digital twins in the Robonomics parachain;</li>\n<li>Money for robots: integration of the most popular cryptocurrencies and tokens from the Polkadot ecosystem through XCMP;</li>\n<li>Smart contracts for robots: access to smart contracts using a bridge to Ethereum and support for EVM in parachains such as Plasm, Moonbeam, Edgeware;</li>\n<li>NFT identity for mobile robotics through projects such as Acala and Distributed Sky whitepaper;</li>\n<li>Tokenization of data from IoT devices for the environmental liability market based on DAO IPCI;</li>\n<li>A managed access to IoT systems using DAO for collective management of public, corporate and private spaces;</li>\n<li>Robotics Smart leasing and bond issue for the installation of robots in smart cities with distribution in the DeFi market.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"in-conclusion\"><a href=\"#in-conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>In conclusion</h2>\n<p>Robonomics is an infrastructure project for the Polkadot network, which aims to place more than 1 million digital twins of IoT devices with a level of security and global availability that the cloud platforms operated by IT corporations cannot provide. Robonomics developers will provide integration for these digital twins with ecosystem projects and thereby open access to previously inaccessible tools for automation systems of city living, logistics and production, namely, direct access to fintech solutions without banks.</p>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-cover-web.62c183a.0a239770c06887970e47fe72652c3f12.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-cover-web.9ea8d39.0a239770c06887970e47fe72652c3f12.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-cover-web.6b2ed88.0a239770c06887970e47fe72652c3f12.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-cover-web.62c183a.0a239770c06887970e47fe72652c3f12.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-3c9ebd43c9b3aeb43553232bcaa42135'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-3c9ebd43c9b3aeb43553232bcaa42135)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAQQDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAABBgcCAwgF/8QALBAAAQMDAgUCBgMAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFEQYSEyExQVEHYQgUInGBkSQyQv/EABgBAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBAMB/8QAIxEAAQQCAgEFAQAAAAAAAAAAAgABAxEEIRJBMQVRweHw8f/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A6ppA%2b9I0qELB11tptTjq0obSMqUo4AHkmvHs2poF5lTWrcXHWooG%2bRjDRJ7A9T%2bsVWnrhrK2abnRYOoo14nx5Lanmm4K22m28Hb9RUcqV3GeXtUNtnr9pKLZja29M3NuKtBQ6lDzKeJkYJJC85I96dgd60t3fHGF92fXTN8v%2b8ropdxSmREaS044JAyHEDKU8vNFOPtN7eI4hG9WxO5QG5Xge9UBbviC05Dt7UODZLsxHbQG208ZlRQB05qUT%2b6kPp1r63avcmwbZZJRMBXzbIecQQhaiQkf35/6PYfmgojZ7rXupxIXbztXDg%2bR%2bqcZ7mhoMn5lokoW04nAWhWMpOM45feiBSLqemNOaWKEKJ620HZdZhsXlL54aChJaXtOCc%2bDUBm%2bjOh4rqg/e7s27gpLfz6AcY6Y2VYsuS9crpNhqdWzFiFCVJaVtU6VDPNQ5gDwOvemTb0NpCYSkxUgYw22mm5lVWqo8UB2b7ff7%2bKvoHpDouSUtsXy6qexzaE9BUM%2b2ytts0FadA3d1NglSUiUyOMh98LWQCcdAMDmfv8Aip4qAl0/y1pkpxja42nkfIOM0BKtsZ2422HPSuZBW4eGy8snhqAyDnqpPLoc9evao/UYZcvGKAD48u1tHFGB8x3XX39IrRkt12VOYdkNuJG1aE5%2bsDpz7kcutSugLPaYdnjKj25ngsqWV7ASQknxnoPaj6MLHLGgCEy5OLVajmNjNyZqtf/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}}]}}},"context":{}}
