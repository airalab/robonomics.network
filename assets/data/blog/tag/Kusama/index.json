Upon launching, [release 1.4  of \"Kusama Parachain Launch\"](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.4.0) – which can be used to launch a [collator](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-collator) – was posted on GitHub.\n\n[Together with p2p.org](https://economy.p2p.org/p2p-validator-and-robonomics-announce-partnership-for-launch-of-parachains-on-kusama/), we launched the first of the parachain collators. During the first week of parachain operation, an open network of [40+ collators](https://telemetry.parachain.robonomics.network/#/Robonomics) emerged. \n\nLet me remind you that the role of the collator is to collect parachain block candidates and transfer them for validation to the Kusama Relay chain’s network of validator nodes. Parahcain collators perform calculations on the current block, and try to propagate the formed block as soon as possible among parachain collators. In return, the collator receives a small, guaranteed amount of XRT as a reward for the computations spent plus 50% of all commissions generated in the block. \n\nTwo [days into the parachain launch](https://discord.com/channels/803947358492557312/895723411278557227/930224374630473738), a contest was held amongst the community members to see who could set up the first collators. \n\nOn the third day, [Subscan switched](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1480833207834664960) swapped over the Robonomics parachain block explorer from the testnet (Frontier Network) to the mainnet.\n\nThe Robonomics wiki was updated tp provide community-tested instructions for building and running a parachain collator, including:\n\n- [how to build a collator node from source](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/how-to-build-collator-node/)\n- [how to launch the Robonomics collator](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/how-to-launch-the-robonomics-collator/)\n\nIssues related to the work of collators can be discussed:\n\n- on Discord: https://discord.gg/hBJS7uE2NC\n- or on Element: https://app.element.io/#/room/#robonomics:matrix.org\n\n## Runtime Parachain for today\n\nFor everyone who is not yet familiar with the concept of runtime, I would advise you to read this article first: https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/frame/ \n\nThe current runtime structure of Robonomics is as follows:\n\n<Card>\n\n### Robonomics Parachain\n\n#### Cyber physical system functions\n- Digital twin\n- Launch\n- Datalog\n- Robot-as-a-service\n\n#### IoT Subscription\n- Subscription auction\n- Staking\n\n#### Onchain governance\n- Treasury\n- Tech comm\n- Democracy\n\n#### Token\n- Balances\n- Transaction \n- Multisig\n- Vesting\n\n#### Network maintenance\n- Lighthouse \n- Identity\n\n</Card>\n\nYou can read the technical descriptions of the runtime modules specific to the Robonomics parachain at the following link: https://crates.robonomics.network/pallet_robonomics_datalog/index.html \n\nAdditionally, we will also talk separately about Robonomics parachain modules as we approach the Winter Developer School 2022, which will be held in February.\n\n## Establishment of the Parachain Technical Committee\n\n![the Parachain Technical Committee](./images/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/1-parachain-technical-committee.png)\n\nThe six project developers who most frequently participated in frontier network development were added into the [Parachain Technical Committee](https://wiki.polkadot.network/ru-RU/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee). \n\nThe Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda, which are fast-tracked for voting and implementation. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n\n## Parachain Treasury replenished and good to go\n\nSimilar to how the Kusama Network [Treasury](https://wiki.polkadot.network/ru-RU/docs/learn-treasury) works, the Robonomics developers plan to use over 400,000 XRT to support the community. Examples of requests to the Kusama Treasury are available here kusama.polkassembly.io.\n\nInstructions on how to submit a request to the Robonomics Treasury and details regarding priority areas for funding will be discussed separately in subsequent blog articles.\n\n![Robonomics Treasury](./images/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/2-Treasury.png)\n\nThe Treasury is available at: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/treasury\n\n## 1/12th of crowdloan reward for participants of the 4th crowdloan campaign distributed and the launch of the vesting module\n\nRobonomics Developers have completed the distribution of 1/12th of the crowdloan rewards to the balances of crowdloan contributors. You can check the balance using Developer > Chain state > system.account():FrameSystemAccountInfo\n\n![Robonomics Chain state] (./images/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/3-chain-state.png)\n\nThe free value as shown in the screenshot corresponds to 1,102,517,448 Wn ≈ 1.1 XRT (the free balance is displayed in micro XRT 10<sup>−6</sup> )  and this is the free balance available for transfer within the network.\n\nThe vesting module was also enabled in the latest runtime update. This week 11/12 bounties are being sent out, which will also show up in Developer > Chain state > system.account():FrameSystemAccountInfo under \"miscFrozen\".\n\nThe full crowdloan contribution reward will be unlocked linearly within the next 11 months. The amount available for unlocking can be seen in the “vested” field of the Accounts page.\n\n![The amount available for unlocking](./images/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/4-amount-available.png)\n\nTowards the end of January, we will provide more information regarding claiming an additional 1 XRT per 1 KSM contributed during the crowdloan for those who own a Robonomics Pioneer NFT.  Robonomics Developers will report this separately on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).\n\n## Migrating XRT from the frontier network\n\nOver the past six months, we have continued to test the functionality of the parachain in the [frontier network](https://robonomics.network/blog/robonomics-frontier/). In the first week of the life of the parachain in Kusama, developers stopped the work on the frontier network, and distributed parachain balances to Kusama.\n\n![frontier network](./images/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/5-frontier-network.png)\n\nAs you can see in the screenshot, the last block of the Robonomics parachain on the frontier network relay chain is #1,046,628, and the frontier network stopped producing blocks 143 hours ago. \n\nYou can check your balance at the time of the last block in the frontier network using the link (Developer > Chain state > system.account: AccountInfo): \nhttps://parachain.robonomics.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmain.frontier .rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/chainstate \n\nIt should be noted that the transfer of balances was a multi-layered task:\n- To begin with, free and staked tokens were collected.\n- Later, staking rewards were collected, which have not yet been received by users (not claimed).\n- Rewards were also added to them and requested for withdrawal but not withdrawn from staking.\n- 11/12th of the crowdloan rewards for participating in the 1st crowdloan campaign (“Plan B” rewards) were deducted from user balances (see below).\n- Received values were added up and sent to one developer owned address for distribution.\n- 11/12th of the crowdloan rewards for participants of the 4th crowdloan campaign were sent into vesting for 11 months.\n\nThus, the initial balance of participants on Kusama parachain should consist of:\n- XRT Tokens transferred via the exodus bridge.\n- Staking rewards generated in the lifetime of the parachain which existed on the frontier network relay chain.\n- Collators rewards\n- 1/12th of the crowdloan contribution reward from participation in the 1st crowdloan campaign (“Plan B” rewards).\n- 1/12th of the crowdloan contribution rewards from participation in the 4th (winning) crowdloan campaign\n\n## XRT staking on Kusama Parachain\n\nIn the second update of the Robonomics parachain, the XRT staking module was included.\n\n![Robonomics dapp](./images/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/6-Robonomics-dapp.png)\n*An example of working with the staking section in Robonomics dapp*\n\nXRT staking is available on the Robonomics dapp at the following link: https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/staking/ \n\nThe staking reward is approximately 10% per year.\n\nFor participants in the 4th crowdloan campaign, the Robonomics developers have increased the staking reward to 50%. Please note that this percentage of staking reward is limited only to the amount of XRT generated via your participation in the 4th crowdloan campaign.\n\nIt should be noted that the full implementation of the [autonomous parachain life cycle](https://robonomics.network/blog/automating-kusama-crowdloan-campaigns/) will change the constant values of the staking reward to variables that adapt to the size of the KSM staking reward on the Relay chain. This topic will be further discussed with more detail in the Robonomics Whitepaper 2022. After its publication, we will begin to change the network.\n\n## The most important lies ahead!\n\nRobonomics application scenarios [are already moving from the frontier network to the Kusama parachain](https://twitter.com/EnsRationis/status/1481900111856906240). Towards the end of January, we will announce the dates of the Robonomics demo week of IoT projects which are ready to present their solutions based on the Kusama parachain. \n\nFollow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) for updates, and remember that Robonomics does not aim to be a unicorn amongst crypto projects until we pave a sustainable development path for user growth. During 2022, dozens of interesting web3 application scenarios in the field of IoT await us. Still, the project will only take its rightful place when Robonomics becomes useful for thousands of regular users. In the meantime, we all need to continue to work and help develop the project; try to change the world around you towards the introduction of web3 technologies; for example, connect Home Assistant to data transfer from IoT devices via the Robonomics parachain: [Leemo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB2Z8HtERgs) ([Instruction on GitHub](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome)).\n\n<KusamaSlotBanner />","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.a91f22a663dc8263b1af8d08cc9bf7d6.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.a91f22a663dc8263b1af8d08cc9bf7d6.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.a91f22a663dc8263b1af8d08cc9bf7d6.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.a91f22a663dc8263b1af8d08cc9bf7d6.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-0a31050eecab9efb6bb77ede7a741a8c'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-0a31050eecab9efb6bb77ede7a741a8c)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAwADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUGAAMHAf/EAC0QAAICAQQABQIFBQAAAAAAAAECAwQRAAUSIQYTMUFRByIUI1JhkTJCcaHx/8QAGQEAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgQGBQMH/8QALBEAAQMDAgMIAgMAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEIQUxEkFhBhNRcYGRobEUIzLR8P/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Ah624GpWkRCyMx7ZQMnQ1VGsW%2bHM4dgA0nyfnRFCPzZmXzYYhwJLS%2bnXt6Hs6qrfhqV1rXd18QUFt2kWYo7hmAwMZJYe2B18a9GvdWYsSlD54QrbBJJHQA%2btTjVhPE43/AC50BH4dRKjTTTNIR/bH1/3SzdacOyE2N3kaKkJOOEXnIc/0jHXZ/wA6N3qSWldWtBuVadDGp8%2bsOlz6qSM9j311X6aNtd61XWWo1%2b69cvKJeP4cIgADHln7uX8d6Xu79SbcPMgkKBIMRHhIMH486Vt2blLwS%2bsZOR/UYriAVZYlnrlnhcckLLxbH7j20y8O%2bHtz8RXDX2qsZSg5SyseMcK/qdz0o/38apvq5BRqeJ3goxPXlRfz4sgqpJyoXAAAC46HzoKDa7T7bVjr07al%2bL4FxRG6MPuwueiR86BercNu25GVD66Yx4VVaLoLmplz9gSEEb9Z%2bozUraiEFmWJZY5ljcoJI88XwcZGcHB1r07ji26CxPXvUJzNyURrFYBC9dg9dk9e/WtfiDaJttkjlas8FafPlB2DHr1BPzorfWmHXk25wpUxMZimNX7OK0pvvHXUknYcztt5TSpJGjyUOD86u/BWy7Q0dkb5A0tl16CEkRqcY6XHZz6561BaPG8biFKi5MARxODjI%2bNOX1sq5aLaTE1OtOracStPL/Yoe7CIbDcEdYHy8Jf1aMk8Tn31dfTzexQr7nDMhWVtvnrowIGOQUgnPQ99RDlxHDydnUxjiGOQoBYce/boHTDZLtKpHMtynYscwFPlWjCCmMcT9pzrJvNRBQWY4iME7bVZ2HYl%2b8ZTdLUEg5A3OfUAe9Nfqhuke8eMdxtV424sI%2bRbGRhFHt%2b%2bpHk36tNN4t1rc6S1a0sBxh/Nn84swBAOSBjrrS2YgcAQSW6Bz6AKP50dnesuBDDqNoA59PSut72Z1HR2FXVq8QN1AEpPwYMedeB2VgVY5HYI0du%2b8393MR3Cw0xiUKufgDGl%2bs1rfhW/Gl3uxxJ2MCRNRlxdv3RBfcKo2kkx71//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"RMRK x Robonomics Network: Pallet integration and Kanaria rewards","path":"/blog/partnership-with-rmrk-announcement/","date":"December 23, 2021","description":"Robonomics is thrilled to announce we have partnered with RMRK to bring a robotics theme to the Kanaria project and support RMRK2.0 standards! Kanaria is the most advanced NFT project in the world built on the world’s most advanced NFT protocol: RMRK.","content":"import KusamaSlotBanner from '~/components/blocks/KusamaSlotBanner.vue'\n\n[Kanaria](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/) is the most advanced NFT project in the world built on the world’s most advanced NFT protocol: [RMRK](https://rmrk.app/).\nKanaria NFTs are birds that can own and even equip other NFTs, building an item economy that can span not only different projects (automatic cross project compatibility) but also different chains due to being launched on Kusama - a “Layer 0” for chains to connect through. Kanaria are also the precursor to RMRK’s upcoming metaverse - [Kanaria: Skybreach](https://url.rmrk.app/meta).\n\nRobonomics has committed to supporting the addition of RMRK’s pallets into their runtime, thereby integrating natively with the world’s most advanced NFT logic (the addition is still subject to community governance vote). This integration allows RMRK 2.0 NFTs to natively exist on Robonomics' upcoming parachain, and has implications for the extension and exploration of how NFTs built on the RMRK standard can be utilized in IoT applications and complex robotics.\n\nAs one of the first projects engaging and building within the Polkadot ecosystem, Robonomics offers a platform to build Web3 robotic solutions and applications for use cases within supply chain, payments systems, production, digital passports, and *robots-as-a-service*.\n\nRMRK on the other hand will reward the top 500 crowdloaners [participating in Robonomics crowdloan](https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot/). These champions will be airdropped a special Kanaria-compatible item - a child NFT that can be equipped onto one’s Kanaria bird, and may bestow advantages in [RMRK’s metaverse](https://url.rmrk.app/meta).\n\nYou do not have to have a Kanaria bird to get this bonus item, but you do have to be in the top 500 contributors.\n\n## About Robonomics\n\nRobonomics is an open-source platform for IoT applications. They support a new generation of internet technologies (web3) that implements the exchange of technical and economic information in the form of atomic transactions between user applications, IoT services, and complex robotics.\n\nThe Robonomics platform provides tools for working with the robot economy network. Robonomics allow designers of smart cities and industry 4.0 zones to build trust among the autonomous robots services, provide direct user access via dapp for ordering products from autonomous factories and services of urban sensor networks. This in turn allows Robonomics and it’s users to put in place a decentralized system that globally monitors the activities of cyber physical systems.\n\n\n## About RMRK\n\n[RMRK](https://rmrk.app/) is a team spearheading the development of the RMRK protocol for creating highly composeable “NFT legos” using NFTs on the [Kusama](https://kusama.network/).\n\nAmong others, RMRK brings the following features to the NFT table:\n\n* emoting to NFTs on chain\n* custom burn messages\n* NFTs owning NFTs\n* NFTs that have conditional rendering (if this, show that)\n* NFTs that have slots for upgrades\n* NFTs that have multi-resources (i.e. contain both code for a game and high-res cover art)\n* NFTs that can be governed as DAOs\n\nIt thereby far exceeds what the current ERC721 / ERC1155 standards and their derivatives can do.\n\n\n<KusamaSlotBanner

first cohort of teams who have secured crowdloans can now provide a foundation that future teams can build from to better price, and automate the process of securing crowdloans and winning auctions.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\nimport KusamaSlotBanner from '~/components/blocks/KusamaSlotBanner.vue'\n\n\n\nThe initial parachain slot auctions and their associated crowdloans suffered from a first mover disadvantage that caused their prices to be difficult to predict and often too high.  This disadvantage is common in any new market undergoing price discovery, especially markets like the parachain auctions where teams are launching diverse products with diverse needs.\n\nThe experience and data from the first cohort of teams who have secured crowdloans can now provide a foundation that future teams can build from to better price, and automate the process of securing crowdloans and winning auctions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Robonomic core developers will implement an automated oracle beginning with the 4th parachain crowdloan campaign in order to participate in future Kusama parachain slot auctions. This mechanism will allow the robonomics team to automate payment of each future parachain slot lease at renewal.  The robonomics team hopes that this effort will inspire other future teams to use or implement their own automated process to better streamline and reduce the downside risks for teams of the overall slot auction system.\n\n## Parameters currently independently determined by Parachains\n\n> Contribution Cap; Campaign Period; Participant Rewards; Source of Rewards; Distribution of Tokens.\n\nTo mitigate risk and unpredictability for both projects and participants, and to help keep the cost of winning these auctions realistic and in line with their value proposition, we would propose that these aforementioned parameters are evaluated and subsequently determined not independently by Parachains, but by an automated oracle. With application and in due time, we anticipate this oracle could be integrated as a common good parachain on Kusama and eventually Polkadot. \n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOften overlooked in the excitement of these initial Crowdloans and their generous rewards mechanisms, is the reality that winning projects have a 48 week lifespan as a working operating parachain on Kusama before their lease expires and they are required to renew their position. \n\nWith this in mind, we’ve laid out a v1 summary of our automated oracle algorithm and the conditions under which it could be relevant and effective in the context of the larger slot auction protocol. \n\n\n## Autonomous oracle of crowdloan campaigns\n\nSo often, you want to be first, but over time you realize that it's more important to stay in the game. The Polkadot ecosystem is just the kind of place where it doesn't matter whether you are the first or the last, what matters is that there is a \"free chair\" for you. We wonder if in your childhood you played the game [“musical chairs”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_chairs), but we remember it very well from kindergarten.\n\nOf course, there is an important specificity here as well: the parachain slot lease must be extended before the end of the current lease, otherwise, there may be an interruption or complication in parachain services (the parachain will switch to [Pay-as-you-go Parachains](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06),  also known as a parathread, for some time).\n\n![\"Polkadot ecosystem\"](./images/automating-kusama-crowdloan-campaigns/polkadot-ecosystem.jpg)\n\nIn general, it's important to stay in line. Below we will talk about the first version of our proposed algorithm for autonomous calculation of the main parameters of crowdloan campaign oracle. Perhaps we should give it a name, but so far nothing interesting comes to mind.\n\n### Contribution Cap Averaging\n\nWithin this model we would propose that the automated oracle calculates and averages the median cost in KSM required to win each auction from #15 - #29. This resulting averaged cost would be set as the KSM Crowdloan contribution cap for slot #30. \t\t\n\n### Lifespan of a crowdloan campaign\n\nWe assume that one Crowdloan Campaign should aim to collect for 5 weeks. In case of failure, the oracle will have to shift the sample estimate of the median fees from a range of [15-29] auctions to [20-34] and so on, to account for the results of previous auctions. In this way, there will be an automatic setup up to the point of successfully obtaining a slot.\n\n### Evaluation of the reward for each KSM in favour of the crowdloan campaign\n\nThis is the most complex part of the oracle algorithm, requiring the infrastructure of the running parachains. Predicting the cyclically repeating economy of parachains operating for several years now, we remain true to the view that [the reward for crowdloan campaign participants is equal to the lost profit from staking in the Relay chain](https://robonomics.network/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/).\n\nMost importantly, the reward from staking can be autonomously estimated by an oracle with a fairly high degree of accuracy. For example, we can now talk about a lost profit of 0.19 KSM for every 1 KSM during the year. However, the lost revenue metric alone is not enough, since the reward in parachain is offered in the parachain native token. It is due to this that the scheme gets a little more complicated, but not by too much. We assume that the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems will always have price tickers for native parachain tokens. For example, Karura’s $KAR may be such a ticker already this year in the Kusama network. We get that the oracle independently, without help from anyone outside, can: (1) obtain data about the current staking fee in the Relay chain, (2) autonomously obtain data about the price of a native parachain token from the DeFi segment of the ecosystem ticker and, based on that data, make an offer similar to the KSM staking.\n\nThe DOT and KSM holder will split their bag of tokens between staking in the Relay chain and supporting several (maybe several dozen) crowdloan campaigns, based on a desire to keep the reward as it would be if all DOT/KSM were staked, but diversifying the risk of a single token price. Yes, right now the rewards in parachains are more viewed as a percentage of all native tokens, and figures of 20% of total supply don't seem inflated in the community. Although it's hard to imagine a picture where every year 20% of all tokens will be offered just for slot rentals. Still, this is the genesis state at the stage of the first auctions and, again, a normal picture at the start. However, taking current rewards for everyday life for a decade is not a good idea.\n\nThe main criterion for calculating the reward will be the lost profit from staking in the crowdloan campaign of any of the projects and the conversion of this value into the number of native tokens at the current rate. This task can be performed by an autonomous process.\n\n### Reward source and token distribution in parachain\n\nWe propose to implement a mechanism for issuing new tokens in the parachain through the treasury module. In turn, the parachain treasury will distribute new parachain coins among the crowdloan campaign participants on a monthly basis throughout the current slot lease term.\n\n## Closing the loop\n\nAbove, we gave a generalized description of the first version of the oracle algorithm, which is intended to make the Robonomics protocol more viable without direct developer involvement. However, it is even more important to understand the connection between the slot lease in the ecosystem and the target function of the project. In the case of Robonomics, it is a fee to store, update and interact the user with the digital twin of the cyber-physical system. Our goal on the horizon of 3 years is to form a Robonomics segment capable of serving up to 1 million digital twins per month at ~0.25 XRT.\n\nIf the target load is reached, we will have more than $60 million per year in demand for XRT purchases in the marketplace, which will be burned off when the subscription is activated.\n\n(I’ll talk more about the subscription life cycle separately when I publish the next release of Robonomics, dedicated to the subscription auction mechanism). It turns out that the value of XRT will not decline if the number of subscriptions sold for XRT during the year cumulatively exceeds the value that the treasury of parachain will pay according to the oracle of crowdloan campaigns.\n\nIn general, my team and I are on a course to create this scheme, which should make it possible to close the tokenomics of the parachain from the moment the slot is obtained to the moment the lease is renewed. We want to make this process as autonomous of human will as possible, and leave only the token holders and developers to propose improvements to the algorithm through the mechanism of democracy and the parachain technical committee. No handwork in perspective. In the meantime, as always happens with hypotheses, we will still take the first steps manually. Below is how the oracle of the future would work for the 4th crowdloan campaign (roughly).\n\n## The parameters of the fourth crowdloan campaign\n\n<Card>\n\n### Collection limit **47,425.5262 KSM**\n\nBased on fees assessment of the 15th auction, Geshiro\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Duration **5 weeks**\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Remuneration **4.20 XRT**\n\n1 KSM ~ 370$ APR = 19%,<br/>1XRT ~ 17$\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Bonus\n\nPioneer NFT cardholders will receive an extra 1XRT for each KSM\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Distribution rewards **Monthly**\n\nProportionally equal shares for 12 months.

The Robonomics developers expected to regain support from at least half of the participants of the first crowdloan campaign, so we were hoping to receive at least 15,000 KSM in the first few days of our crowdloan,  this would have helped us  make our way into the top five projects of the second round, allowing us to be on the radars of KSM holders who hadn't yet decided on what project to choose. However,  KILT bursting onto the scene with the MOVR token made waves throughout the whole community, giving them an undeniable advantage over the rest of the participants at the start.\n\nAt the same time, with KILT receiving the maximum amount of investment from the community, pack leaders emerged from the projects that had collected more than 20,000 KSM tokens on the second day of the second round of auctions. Unfortunately, this led to Robonomics failing to enter the community's shortlist during the first few days of the second round, and thus did not receive much attention. The battle for slots between Calamari, Basilisk Heiko and Altair saw extremely high stakes and unexpected twists (thanks to the auction mechanism with a candle for the special effects during the Heiko vs. Altair battle).\n\n![\"Kusama Crowdloan Timeline\"](./images/kusama-crowdloan-third-wave-details/image2.png)\n\nHow much will Robonomics raise in the third round? Will it be comparable to the first campaign, in the region of 20k - 30k KSM tokens? Or more akin to the results of the second round, around 3k to 10k KSM? Only holders of Kusama Relay Chain tokens know the answer. Most importantly, we expect a reduction in fundraising requirements to win one of the next auctions on the Kusama network.\n\n## Third Robonomics crowdloan\n\n### Parameters\n\nRobonomics developers will publish the KSM crowdloan module on 23 October with the following parameters:\n\n- The start of the crowdloan campaign: 23 Oct 2021\n- For each KSM bonded, you'll get 3.5 XRT over 48 weeks\n- 1.725 XRT will be unlocked within the first month after the Robonomics parachain launch\n- KSM bonders will get the entire reward within one year of XRT staking with an increased APR of up to 100%\n\n### Bonuses\n\n- Extra reward for everyone who bonds the first 6,300 KSM. Get 6 XRT instead of 3.5 XRT in a year\n- Extra reward for Robonomics Pioneer NFT holders who bond the first 27,000 KSM. Get 6 XRT instead of 3.5 XRT in a year\n\nCrowdloan rewards will be distributed in the Robonomics parachain. There won't be an option to get rewards in ERC-20 XRT.\n\n## Real-world use cases on Kusama!\n\nThe main use-case that Robonomics can bring to the Kusama ecosystem are small but fully-fledged scenarios for the application of Polkadot technologies in the real economy.\n\nDuring [Polkadot Decoded 2021](https://youtu.be/rbjOmJmilAg) and during the second crowdloan campaign, in an article titled ['Polkadot for the IoT market...'](/blog/polkadot-for-iot-with-robonomics/), I already talked about the services that we created during the experiments of 2017 - 2019 and that we are ready to launch on the Kusama network in the coming months. In this article, I will only briefly describe some of the more complete services again.\n\n### Civic Sensor Map\n\nFor the third year running, the non-profit organisation Airalab Rus has been conducting an experiment to build a decentralised sensor map of air and water pollution in an industrial city on the Volga with a population of 700,000 people (the city of Tolyatti). At the moment, the network of sensors covers almost the entire city, and also measures not only particles, but also more complex chemical compounds such as formaldehyde and ammonia. In 2019, the hardware/software framework for monitoring water was selected for demonstration at the IoT World Congress in Barcelona, and recognised as one of the most unusual and interesting solutions in the field of the Internet of Things. In December 2019, the project was announced as part of the next **UN Climate Change Conference**, and in 2021 it **received additional funding from the European Union** to connect sensors certified according to local legislation.\n\nThe Civic Sensor Network is an example from the world of Web3, in which technology allows us to overcome the most common problems related to non-commercial activity, such as the inability to give one person super admin rights. \n\nYou can learn more about the project on the Airalab Rus: https://airalab.org/en/air-monitoring\n\n### Digital Twins for Smart Leasing\n\nMerklebot, which uses Robonomics technologies, has implemented two robot-as-a-service scenarios over the past 12 months, one in the spirit of Industry 4.0 and another in the field of EdTech.\n\nThere is an interesting new use case in Robonomics - For four months already, an industrial manipulator has been operating in a manufacturing facility in the United States with an hourly wage. At the end of each shift, the manipulator updates its digital twin instance stored in the parachain. Based on the changes in the digital twin, an invoice is issued for the use of the manipulator structured as IoT-enabled leasing.\n\nThus, we can say that Kusama will be an example of a fintech solution from Web3 for the new Industry 4.0. Someday the public will understand the significance of this use case, and we will see a boom of DeFi in this modern industry!\n\n### Meet Spot, our Robodog\n\nThis summer, the first group of engineers learned to work with our own Spot as part of the spot-sdk.education course. By the end of September, anyone anywhere in the world can take our course and get their hands on the robodog from Boston Dynamics. The course is developed by robotics specialists from the ITMO University in St. Petersburg with Merklebot acting as the local operator in the San Francisco Bay Area lab, the home of our Spot.\n\nAccessing Spot is organised with the use of two parachains, Robonomics and Statemine. Logs from the students taking the course will be recorded on the Robonomics parachain, while the Statemine parachain is being used to replace user accounts with unique access tokens that students will receive after paying for their course.\n\n### Distributed Sky\n\nThis project is related to drone flight regulation: registration of pilots, drones, flight restricted zones and route announcements. The main goal of the proof-of-concept was to demonstrate that blockchain can be used to announce and register flight routes, mitigating the risk of dispatching errors. Such systems can be used as a base for transport and delivery systems for automated vehicles. While implementing decentralised identifiers for pilots and UAVs is not so complex (blockchain is a DID and SSI system by default), storing information about geo-zones and their polygons, and checking intersections in one transaction was a difficult task. As a result, a kind of 'geo-index', similar to spatial indexes used in SQL databases, was implemented in runtime logic. The proof-of-concept code allows the REGULATORs to register PILOT accounts, and PILOT accounts to register UAVs and announce UAV routes in blockchain. More info: https://mixbytes.io/blog/mixbytes-robonomics-collaboration-report\n\n### Digital Passports for IoT Systems\n\nTwo projects – one is from New Zealand – are using the parachain for recording data about production manufacturing. In one case data about the content of substances in the ground on farms is collected, and data about the final assembly of medical equipment is collected in the second.\n\nBoth scenarios would help the Kusama network to prove itself as a registry for global production distributors.\n\n## Roadmap for the development of the Robonomics parachain in the Kusama network Q4 2021 - Q2 2022\n\nToday, the Robonomics parachain is undergoing a process of further development and testing within an up-to-date copy of Kusama supported by the developers called Frontier Network, which in turn will significantly reduce the time needed to implement these updates after launch on Kusama. Also, all the balances of parachain users in the Frontier Network will be transferred to the Robonomics parachain managed by Kusama as soon as possible.\n\nBy mid-September, the developers had implemented [updates 1.1 Staking and 1.2 Treasury and Technical Committee](https://robonomics.network/blog/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/). In the coming weeks, Robonomics will be ready for the release of 1.3 RWS, which will allow the launch of a full cycle of XRT tokenomics in the parachain for issuing RWS subscriptions. RWS subscriptions are a unique mechanism based on the ability of developers to build their own communication protocol in a shared security environment. RWS will introduce blockchain technology to the IoT market using a familiar subscription model for users, guaranteeing priority processing of transactions in each block. This will protect IoT devices that need to update the state of their digital counterparts to display information in the users' application regularly and predictably over time. An article titled 'Update 1.3 RWS' will be published at the end of October.\n\nThus, the updated roadmap for the development of the Robonomics parachain for the period of slot leasing will look like this:\n\n### Part 1: Establishing Core Functionality\n\nThree months after the launch of the Robonomics parachain, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionality that's been in development in the past couple of years, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n- **Done! Genesis state: (week 0)** Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collator reward systems.\n- **Done! Update 1.1** Staking and allowing transfers (week 0 - 1). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with 10% APR for all token holders and 50% for Crowdloan participants.\n- **Done! Update 1.2** Treasury and Technical Committee. Will allow a share of DAO funds to be transferred from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n- **Current process... Update 1.3** RWS (week 2 - 3). Will allow use of IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n- **Update 1.4** Robot-as-a-service (week 4 - 6). Will allow implementation of a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n- **Update 1.5** XCMP Functionality and Robobank (week 8 - 10). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n- **Update 1.6** Democracy and Remove Sudo (week 11 - 13). Developers won't have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the Technical Committee or a vote by parachain native token holders.\n\n### Part 2: Launch Services Based on Robonomics R&D\n\nThe second part of the roadmap is designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics R&D projects.\n\n- **Globally available digital passports for products.** By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the products produced, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case has already been implemented as a pilot at a company that produces drones. It is used for quality control during packaging with video recording\n- **Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics.** We'll demonstrate the how you can use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device using the example of two robots controlled by the Robonomics parachain in two different industries. The first use case is an educational programme based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog Spot. The second is an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n- **Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits.** It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of a household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n- **Fault-tolerant civic sensor network.** A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or company to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian's industrial cities, Tolyatti.\n- **Self-driving cars and a drone traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas.** This will allow a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes be managed by public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n- **Ecosystem integration updates.** We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem's features.\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for 48 weeks of existence on the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain. This is our vision for the future of Robonomics, as a complete segment of the Polkadot infrastructure specifically intended for working with IoT devices.\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nKusama is an experimental network, and the main reason it is worth participating in any activity surrounding this network is the desire to be involved in a large experiment. When deciding whether you will help Robonomics during the second crowdloan campaign or not, the only question you should be asking yourself is: do I want to see the functionality of putting IoT devices from the real world under the control of the Kusama network in the near future? If the answer is yes, then you are as crazy as we are. You want to change the world, so welcome on board!\n\n\n\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-notification.png'\" :link=\"'https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics'\">\n\n### Join our Twitter\n\nStay tuned and follow updates\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.a9893e28990bd2f815a2b9f921f9d71e.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.a9893e28990bd2f815a2b9f921f9d71e.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.a9893e28990bd2f815a2b9f921f9d71e.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.a9893e28990bd2f815a2b9f921f9d71e.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-8d75cf3b872c912db3b13c18d3f83c08'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-8d75cf3b872c912db3b13c18d3f83c08)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2b1k9yP0GiibOniPjnpAQ3HdVa0t1yAaoizxXg1p7HwWvrrBinksY6W1bIuFS30gCZ3iSZAG4P6VW3c8a4QR3BGi/Oqa29nAY8VhTTlPJ%2bPyQeRSVeBYvUc7mUSUpaZgIU64oX7ygsWeOBQrm/PnSbKVOmgZWO2Leazc7qYrQgQ4khq356WHLoN%2bytZPb7ceT/bXv%2bzIqA39RPLPUFdXVGc%2bJHYdub/xo/3d6WZ7Zu14O9G5%2bLkxVvhChDKj7CySKpQoiwU8ef050KuS9z7sx5ZbjyJseOEhRaZugkK6QSB4HVX/ADRVtpBDyGHEUp6gIDgjT5qb9NdpYDNOz5GfySxBjr9plEdSWXHz3u1pVQrxXc%2bNT3rv6VY7Y2Kweb27NkycPlE0ESukuNqKQsfJIAIIvxxXm9aHoztDC52FlMjuKXMEeE4223DjEILylhR5V3AHT2A/nqz/AFZhSN9bUx%2bNxMVMdOGaUoNvOUfaQ2QjpPkiiDf31wAu2x6NtiQYZuBtPJH7Z96T%2bZW1km1cubt2X/P5/Kl021lW8c%2b81KSpUOSnoc6e6fsRopZl4WMv6peWW%2bkHqDZsknuLHkg/fVea71K1lXLSlV7VocbqHoqoe2r6d11TtzwRtO8Gaktw5Q5fJLkdJQ2AEtpPcJH%2b9R7X5qLBPI4Bq9Y63cGwmTmoDDhIQ7IbQojvRUBoAl235pDJyGuM1%2b6ZJkmmg3HjUT/TKfgH1Ji4XHwnJcZloflrQCsWo2VWSbJPN6WHC5aXhZ6JmPcCH0AhJUkKAsEXR4vnjTHepeRegbNzrMbpAei%2b0okXSSsA1/EcaWI6sur46WrulVgET%2bNZ74cy3y8IPdbU0mZ/viKYf0%2b3fk93tvTsuiJ77LyGgY7Ib6uLsgcXqx21BMLIrI4ER0k/0HVUfhsjtSRIbfT1tqk9rrkN2Do%2b9a82dlbW68bGQ45kOuIVOrJCApBHUB5PJ1EdaxcNbPSdJDMkiANMDV7z9p48VWjpN271Rs5SAitB7zJA9uSfNf/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Update to Version 1.2: Staking, Tech Committee and Treasury","path":"/blog/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/","date":"September 17, 2021","description":"The project developers have implemented 2 important changes in the operation of the Robonomics parachain. The first is the inclusion of XRT staking, and the second is the launch of the first on-chain governance mechanisms.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Update 1.1: Staking\n\n### Theory\n\nDecentralized PoS networks ensure their security by locking the funds of the validators and all token holders on the network who participate in the selection of the validator pool. To reward validators and token holders, an analogous PoW reward model is usually used, based on the inflation + all commission fees in the block. This is how NPoS is implemented in Polkadot/Kusama.\n\n> Notably, both Ethereum and Polkadot include additional conditions for their reward models. Setting inflation targets, dividing the commission fees into several directions, and even burning a certain percentage of the commission fees are additional settings that both mature and newer networks are experimenting with in their implementations.\n\nParachains do not need staking in their core functionality. Parachains are secured by Relay Chain validators. This is a shared security model where the projects compete for slots during auctions.\n\n#### Reinventing Staking\n\nParachains that want to take advantage of the \"wisdom of the crowd\" and assign tasks to the community need to reinvent staking. At Robonomics, that's what we did. The staking architecture in the Robonomics parachain is unique and specific to the blockchain issues that we solve for the IoT market. We offer two ways to pay for the basic functionality of smart devices: per transaction or by monthly subscription.\n\nPer-transaction payment is self-explanatory. The subscription function needs a little explanation. Some IoT use cases need to periodically access cloud functions, and it is highly undesirable for these to fail. The gas-price mechanism still does not fully solve this problem, especially when it comes to guaranteeing transactions on every block. With this in mind, we came up with the idea of using the staking mechanism to manage a guaranteed quota with a subscription model. On the Substrate side, we did a little trick, based on zero-weight transaction priority processing. If an IoT device activates a subscription, then all its transactions will have priority over any others, except of course other zero-weight transactions. As more tokens go into the network's staking pool, more subscriptions will become available to users. \n\n<Card>\n\n*For example:*\n\nTotal tokens: 2,000,000 XRT;\nstaked: 800,000 XRT;\nparachain bandwidth: 5400 tx per block. \n\nThis gives us 5400 * 800,000 / 2,000,000 = 2,160 monthly subscriptions for IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\nI will write about how the subscriptions and the payment pool will be distributed in a separate article entitled “Automated Subscription Auction.”\n\n### Practical Use\n\nDApp ready to go: https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/staking/\n\n![XRT staking in Robonomics dapp, new bonding screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image2.jpg)\n\nAfter the first transaction, you will get a table of statistics like this:\n\n![XRT staking in Robonomics dapp, bonding list screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image4.jpg)\n\nSending tokens between accounts on the parachain will remain disabled. The ability to transfer tokens will be enabled after the parachain goes live on the Kusama network. \n\n### Observations\n\nAs of [block # 235,047](https://robonomics.subscan.io/block/235047), we have approximately one thousand accounts; the largest token holder is the treasury. Treasury funds will not participate in staking.\n\nThe remaining accounts on the network appeared as a result of using the Exodus DApp by ERC-20 token holders, or they were participants in the first crowd loan campaign in the Kusama auctions.\n\nThanks to the integration with Subscan, XRT holders on the Robonomics parachain can use this wonderful interface: https://robonomics.subscan.io/account\n\n![Robonomics Subscan.io account screen](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image3.jpg)\n\nOn the Exodus DApp interface, you can see the migration statistics from the Ethereum blockchain to the Robonomics parachain: https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/exodus\n\n![XRT from the Ethereum blockchain to the Robonomics parachain in Robonomics dapp](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image6.jpg)\n\n### Further Improvements to Staking Functionality\n\nThe current task for the developers is to test the basic staking mechanisms for token holders under real conditions: adding to the staking pool, accumulating rewards, and unfreezing tokens within 7 days. \n\n*An interesting task for the community:* check the correctness of the reward calculator, taking into account the two options: a 10% annual reward for participants in the Exodus migration and a 50% annual reward for members of the crowd loan campaign.\n\nAfter the 1.3 RWS update, the staking mechanism will go live on the network. The RWS update will add subscription capability for digital twins, and the challenge of bandwidth allocation will make sense. Accordingly, we will later be able to fully assess the correctness of the staking mechanism.\n\n## Update 1.2: Tech Committee and Treasury\n\nAs with update 1.1, this has already been implemented into the parachain work. The technical committee is currently made up of six technical specialists who have taken part in the development of the parachain during the last 2 years; the DAO [transferred 692,500 XRT](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6b9a9cbe7d21badf565ebce0fb50b865da8f5f784899db5fb455d1b276d14acf) to the balance of the treasury of the parachain by burning ERC-20 tokens through the Exodus DApp. The network's treasury and technical committee are the first elements of on-chain governance that the parachain developers have implemented so far. More details about each of them are given below.\n\n### Network Technical Committee\n\nThe technical committee portal is available at: https://parachain.robonomics.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmain.frontier.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/techcomm\n\n![The technical committee portal in Robonomics parachain](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image5.jpg)\n\nAs of September 15, you can see the six members of the technical committee that were added: 2 devops specialists, a software architect, the main Substrate implementation developer, a senior robotics engineer, and a senior DApp developer.\nThe technical committee will take care of updating the parachain runtime code, starting with subsequent releases on GitHub.\n\nYou can read more about the work of this committee in the Polkadot wiki: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee\n\nUntil the Robonomics parachain goes live on Kusama, the project developers will not expand on-chain governance by adding councils or referenda. After the successful launch of the parachain, we will revisit the question of new opportunities to influence network operations for new project participants.\n\n### Treasury\n\nThe parachain treasury is available here: https://parachain.robonomics.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmain.frontier.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/treasury\n\n![The treasury in Robonomics parachain](./images/xrt-staking-tech-committee-treasury-updates-1-2/image1.jpg)\n\nOver the past month, ~100k XRT was distributed from the treasury to the balances of participants in the first Robonomics crowd loan campaign from Summer 2021. These operations are not shown as requests, but rather done by Sudo. Now that we have a technical committee, requests will go through a vote. \n\nIt is also worth noting an interesting mechanism of the treasury: the periodic burning of balances. You can read more about the work of the treasury in the Polkadot wiki: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-treasury\n\nThe community can request that the parachain treasury allocate XRT for tasks that will be useful in the development of Robonomics in the Polkadot ecosystem or for attracting users from the IoT market.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere are many exciting updates to come, and each will open up new opportunities for the community. Updates to the project's community development program will soon be published with more information on what will be available to the community over the next 6 months.\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\" imageSize=\"big\">\n\nEnsRationis\n\nRobonomics network architect\n\nelement: @ensrationis:robonomics.network\n\n</Card>\n\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-notification.png'\" :link=\"'https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics'\">\n\n### Join our Twitter\n\nStay tuned and follow updates\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.62c183a.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.9ea8d39.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg 480w","/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.6b2ed88.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/113_Up_to_version_1_2_stakingtech_comm_treasury.62c183a.2c7250a2bc55e91545baebf379feaec2.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-238be7fd79705754b94eb1b07ee8d544'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-238be7fd79705754b94eb1b07ee8d544)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bYI5ICe%2bQ4G4Ae4zkgj40bdr9PHXR0dEoYlQRJISRj%2bkZ7D5/x305lNK93C0IHSNaLlGoL49MkywW1lzlnSZ2XbkAEHH51LF4MkmyO3mNT6SXcHH3476qvTPXFXeVq7bVKlNc1ikMTRsTG5XuNrHgjg4PB76tfTlbNU25JJSZOAvm7CnmekZJX2Ocg%2b3HGklpG6vqqCakcWyixHz2/exRtItUKYtV/TiQHtCSRj8kZzqZZse37ajLIxxsgnl4z/KQtqQWTaCY5FGM%2bpCMfnQ8QGLqSxXN8HjH1W5Gf4Z/a/wDWrl4c%2bI94u3V1so7tJQpSTOVYpBtJO07RnPGTgaQtMxyNdDeCfTVuPRlbeq6BauSpWWMxOMBY07qD8kjOe/A%2bNe31ClpYIS4Ri5wMdVEHOJ3V88QZ5bXRrUW%2bWkhqGdEEckWTU5blQRgg49%2bw99UOmu1RRXyrkuMcIr1kY4J2pzg8e34%2bx0t5L5XV7xPU1E8ix5MKSSs4iBOcAsSfj9tFtcp55GklO53OSdDTabyWWfkndTyyFxwj6G4Vq3lLtFDHSVCbj2yGYjBO09vTxpzeGNQeqLbWVd3jjaaCo8qMwgoANobkZ75OkJNWSbda6orJlDBJHQd/S5H%2btLl0aOSHltwe/VdKt1eauqOfIAABYAbAeq62v1xo%2bk7DX3eVatqelTzJEjwWYZA4zj5%2bdKfqX9QNplsddDaaK5pcXiKwNURRmIP7bsPnGkPW1c7gq00pU9wXJGtJUMedZSeHoIxeU8Rv5faQZ3O2X//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Polkadot for the IoT market: Robonomics is ready for real world use cases on Kusama!","path":"/blog/polkadot-for-iot-with-robonomics/","date":"August 31, 2021","description":"The Robonomics team wants to impact the Kusama network development with four scenarios from the real world. These use cases describe unique opportunities for the crypto audience and all participants of the IoT market.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\nOur team already has various business cases that are ready to leverage the parachain technology. But before we can roll out these use cases we need to obtain a parachain in the [Kusama Parachain Auctions](https://kusama.network/auctions/). So, let’s talk about each of these current use cases.\n\n## Meet Spot, our Robodog\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_xBLkszEwWk\n\nThis summer, the first group of engineers learned to work with our own Spot as part of the [spot-sdk.education](https://spot-sdk.education) course. By the end of September, anyone, anywhere in the world can take our course and get his hands on with the robodog from [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot). The course is developed by robotics specialists from the [ITMO University](https://en.itmo.ru/) in St. Petersburg and [Merklebot](https://merklebot.com/) acting as the local operator in the San Francisco Bay Area lab, the home of our Spot. \n\nAccessing Spot is organized through the use of two parachains - the Robonomics and Statemine parachains. Logs of the students passing the course will be recorded on the Robonomics Parachain where the [Statemine parachain](https://polkadot.network/statemine-upgrade-launches-new-phase-of-parachain-functionality/) is being used to replace user accounts with unique access tokens that students will receive after payment of their course.\n\n## An Urban Sensor Network on the Volga river\n\nOne experiment that is leveraging the power of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/) based Blockchain technologies is currently taking place in Tolyatti. The focus here is creating an alarm network detecting high levels of air pollution without a commercial focus and being dependent on a government, but solely being supported by the citizens of Tolyatti and the Russian Airalab organization. The automatically collected information on exceeding the level of air pollution will be used for a quick response of the mobile laboratory, which is already capable of conducting a detailed analysis of particles in the air.\n\nAll data collected by the Urban Sensor Network will be securely recorded in the Robonomics parachain to avoid any possibility of intervention in the measurement history and provide security from disabling the network during attacks of the main server. \n\nIt is an example of the social impact the Robonomics project can have in these times where [90% of the world's population breathes dirty air](https://www.bloomberg.org/blog/accelerating-clean-air-action-one-data-point-at-a-time/). Thus, with the help of Kusama we can have a trustable, immutable way of storing pollution data which can be used for science to create a better world for all [protected against corrupted actors on both corporate and government level](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/06/05/corruption-is-a-threat-to-planet-earth/).\n\n<Card>\n\nWatch **a step-by-step process** of how to connect an SDS011 Air Quality Sensor to the Robonomics Decentalized Sensor Network from our Community member\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AQ7ZzgbN7jU\n\n</Card>\n\n## Digital Twins for Smart Leasing\n\nThere is an interesting new use case in Robonomics. For four months already, an industrial manipulator has been operating in a manufacturing facility in the United States with an hourly wage. At the end of each shift, the manipulator updates its digital twin instance stored in the parachain. Based on the changes in the digital twin, an invoice is issued for the use of the manipulator structured as IoT-enabled leasing. \n\nThus, we can say that Kusama will be an example of a fintech solution from web3 for the new industry 4.0. [Someday the public will understand the significance of this use case](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/manufacturing/us-supply-chain-of-the-autonomous-robots.pdf), and we will see a boom of DeFi for this modern industry!\n\n## Digital Passports for IoT systems\n\nTwo projects — one is from New Zealand — are using parachains for recording data about production manufacturing. In one case, data about the content of substances in the ground on farms is collected, in the second — data about the final assembling of medical equipment. \n\nBoth scenarios would help the Kusama network to expose itself as a registry for global production distributors.\n\n<Card>\n\n**Project 1** New Zealand’s premier industry is considered to be Agriculture. Climate change and clean water in our rivers are also at the forefront of New Zealand’s concerns. Luckily, with the advances in precision agriculture and the efficiency of our world-leading practices, our sheep and beef farmers can claim to produce less Greenhouse Gas Emissions to get a piece of meat to a dinner table in London than the comparable farmers in Wales:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGMeYKInAk\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n**Project 2** Demonstration of the work of an automated workstation for video recording of the assembly process and testing of complex technical products.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wmeBIbNaBlQ\n\n</Card>\n\n## Second Wave of Kusama Crowdloans\n\nWe would love to see your support for [Robonomics during its crowdloan](https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot/) for the 6-10th parachain slot on the Kusama network so we can implement each use case as soon as possible!\n\nWhile these use cases are just scratching the surface of the potential that the Robonomics Network will bring to the industry 4.0 after obtaining a parachain slot on [Kusama](https://kusama.network/), they demonstrate the numerous capabilities of Web3 that are not yet being explored or utilized. \n\n*This is only the beginning of Robonomics' Web3 journey, and ultimately we plan to enable millions of interoperable IoT devices in the Polkadot ecosystem, including many of which have not yet been conceived, but are already possible with [the technology of Robonomics](https://blog.aira.life/a-brief-introduction-to-robonomics-9b7884172e77)!*\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-future.png'\">\n\n### Want to be a part of the future?\n\nHead over to the [Robonomics Crowdloan page](https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot/) or the [Kusama Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/parachains/crowdloan) and support us building the infrastructure for the Smart Robotic grid of tomorrow!🦾\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-ab82f7b91d70eeb1933e82d3d64ef8a1'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-ab82f7b91d70eeb1933e82d3d64ef8a1)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bqxKvH%2bPY5H7MtyOVZVg3CsqF6pKb36u2Oicuw3JUcCa0l%2b%2bZt1qQSpR2AGogmdZE/wA9aVITcZS1CUpaRbpKR3wCq9YjwHOQ2lUiYrRLLepv9fT%2b%2bN3VUvD3UfDU8b/AMNf9v1ccNzPDFtpARTqehaVApKac8AD3/Uvr98MLvlkdkEU0/e3Ckw0wsE7lMx4CfXyrPaJCgu8KvSqghlEtJUlwZ1ZgcnRywDqAogHMP3txbAiLGadvzpCWQP5kk3/ABjXfNPDkJQDEhZgDmPl79ibaW%2bb64iKp4c85JXEhFq/UlNPfCiL7A83Q%2b2EL1Q2NGi7cTP2HDP4j3rJ240NE9hEiSVRSRzHGk6pF9dDitJbaTIcEdSlMhRyFQ1I7Xwa4qjtO1SpSqBH5NNW6oxS42oISknpB/7gLGadRHbS%2bUqdCQFlJuL99cSQ%2bcmrG2CX3ZQSRGuogGcGNQobjlTJ4SUabV%2bKVKcQyqCwzmlpd1StC1BvLr3Ocn%2bnGpcUcBUXhutcOz49Tg0ZpL6lPIfuFyG02UbK16gNMvodDgTwA2mn1J2K2AWZqUhwWsQUHMkg%2bu498OHjTSo0qj0Z%2by0kOKASpZWACm/f7YZ4ghm64kLVYjs8tlAj1BHOsgavHktl1Kz5nr6yZ8TXnr5Tzq5NUqiWXJLi3UR47HNcSgkkFewTuNLk/QYvsyk0dk1OnSmZTjgWyyxMp6FhRBF1FJ0SOwO5N7euDK%2bH4iiSb30tYWsR3GIaBF5ocuoKuPx6fbFieEguBf1D8oPdhERy7pPLWZzjIkK%2bI7tbZaUskERlXvH6obw9KkcT1p1ufGgJqa45bpsVlhMeO%2b/e4S4U6gkE22BIAJAwtSplRdddVI5YcUrqyMoFiNCLCwHtjQ6bCTTZ8ebEUEyI7gcbUUBQChsbHfHS5SGFqUVbqUVGw7nFim1YSskIEabf7pUYccvEpCUuqEdTikunzKxNaXBfqbceKLKSHUHIEg3OgBudj%2bcVqtIqkaWmMwqFIaaCQX22coULA%2b%2b%2b51w9%2bSx9P8Ynksf/AEYBVkytwqWJTGIEe9AOLPhBQlZAJkwYknJMZJ55r//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Second Robonomics Crowdloan campaign","path":"/blog/kusama-crowdloan-second-wave-details/","date":"August 20, 2021","description":"The second wave of auctions in the Kusama network will start on September 01, 2021. Robonomics will participate in the slot auction starting from the first day of the second wave. Take a look at details","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\nThis is great news indeed! There were many concerns that the successful connection of the first 5 parachains would shift the focus of the entire community and developers to replicating already tried mechanisms in the Polkadot network. But no! Not long after, and you can see how the Kusama network is deciding to hold a second wave of auctions. The Robonomics team is pleased with this news, and we will try to get into the list of projects that can say with confidence they are part of the Polkadot ecosystem in September.\n\nBelow you will find the final parameters of the second crowdloan of the Robonomics company, and the answers to the most interesting questions that we, as the project developers, have tried to proactively highlight.\n\n## From the past to the present\n\nDuring the first auctions of the Kusama network, Robonomics published a crowdloan module for the start of the 3rd auction. It was necessary to try to guess the sufficient fundraising limit. As a result, it was decided to set a collection limit of 135,000 KSM. If you look at the results of auctions from the 3rd to the 5th, then the limit was chosen, we can say with pinpoint accuracy:\n\n![An Overview of the First Five Parachain Slot Auctions on Kusama](./images/kusama-crowdloan-second-wave-details/auctions-on-kusama-overview.png)\n*Source: Making History: [An Overview of the First Five Parachain Slot Auctions on Kusama](https://polkadot.network/making-history-an-overview-of-the-first-five-parachain-slot-auctions-on-kusama/)*\n\nAlso, as can be seen from the statistics of the last Robonomics crowdloan company, about ~ 27,000 KSM were collected in total. Among the projects that participated in the first wave of auctions, such a volume allowed the project to be on the 7th line, i.e. become the second project among those who did not receive a slot in the first wave. In general, we are confident that the second wave of auctions should be successful not only for the Kusama chain, but also for us personally. In general, in order to successfully pass the second wave of auctions, we want to do the main thing - not to change the conditions of participation…\n\n## 2nd Robonomics Crowdloan parameters\n\nRobonomics Developers will publish the KSM crowdloan module on August 30 with the following parameters:\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside grid-3\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n<Card>\n\nRobonomics Parathread ID = 2077\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\nThe start of the crowdloan company - from the 6th auction of the Kusama network.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\nCrowdloan limit - 135,000 KSM\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\nFor each KSM bonded, you’ll get 3.5 XRT on the horizon of 48 weeks\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n1.725 XRT will be unlocked within the first month after the Robonomics parachain launch\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\nKSM bonders will get the entire reward in one year of XRT staking with an increased APR of up to 100%\n\n</Card>\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n<Card>\n\nAll members of the crowdloan company will receive a Robonomics Pioneer NFT card.

By mid-September, we will have to finish checking the functionality of the update 1.1 Staking and 1.2 Treasury and Technical committee updates of the [Frontier network](/blog/robonomics-frontier/), which in turn will significantly reduce the time to implement these updates after the launch in Kusama. Also, all balances of parachain users in the Frontier network will be transferred to the Robonomics parachain managed by Kusama ASAP.\n\nThus, the updated roadmap for the development of the Robonomics parachain for the period of slot leasing will look like this:\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 1: Establishing core functionality\n\nIn 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n* **Genesis state: (0 week)** Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.\n* **Update 1.1** Staking and allowing transfers (0 - 1 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for all token holders and 50% for Crowdloan participants.\n* **Update 1.2** Treasury and Technical committee (2 - 3 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n* **Update 1.3** RWS (4 - 5 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n* **Update 1.4** Robot-as-a-service (6 - 7 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n* **Update 1.5** XCMP functionality and Robobank (8 - 9 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n* **Update 1.6** Democracy and Remove Sudo (10 - 11 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D\n\n2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.\n\n* **Globally available digital passports of products**. By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.\n* **Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics**. We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries. The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n* **Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits**. It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n* **Fault-tolerant civil sensors network**. A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.\n* **Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas**. It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n* **Ecosystem integration updates**. We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain. This is our vision of the future of Robonomics, as a complete segment of the Polkadot infrastructure specifically prepared for working with IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\n## In conclusion\n\nKusama is an experimental network, and the main thing for which it is worth participating in any activity around this network is the desire to be involved in a large experiment. When deciding whether you will help Robonomics during the second crowdloan company or not, the only significant question for you should be - do I want to see the functionality of connecting IoT devices from the real world under the control of the Kusama network in the near future? If you answer is yes, then you are as crazy as we are - you want to turn the world around, which means you are welcome on board!\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-notification.png'\" :link=\"'https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics'\">\n\n### Join our Twitter\n\nStay tuned and follow updates\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.c6e7484481c1104ca1a5fc0088afa978.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.c6e7484481c1104ca1a5fc0088afa978.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.c6e7484481c1104ca1a5fc0088afa978.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.c6e7484481c1104ca1a5fc0088afa978.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-e660ce8152b6856b81da2c955229cb8c'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-e660ce8152b6856b81da2c955229cb8c)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgcEBQgBA//EADEQAAEDAgQEAwYHAAAAAAAAAAECAwQFEQAGEiETMUFRBxSRCCMyYXGhFyRCQ7HB0f/EABkBAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGAQIDBP/EACkRAAEDAwMCBQUAAAAAAAAAAAECAxEABCESMWEFQQZRcYHwEyKRwdH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AE1T6mjUNxzwx22W6fTIj70%2bI5KfJ/Ksr4imkjqtQ2Sb/p3Pe2FFl9GlmZO4aXVRgnShXK5PM/TF3Mnz0MU594IaYdXdQb57K5EXuNuhth9uLs6wlsSBv/K41dAs3Ggq6dKVLH2gJnvEkyBuD7D0pkoqSAndQxFm1NBQbq2wGVGrqpMzSG2nUrSFBLidVt%2bnbESbm5c1S0piXddOka1gpO%2b21ufS98ELcBxCXQMGl248LLtLhbDpykkcV712TCkpWHaghhdyNHCUs9O23f0wMCLBVw9dTQnUFFXuFnSRyHzvgszrkKqUfL7Nfffpz8Va0tOJiE%2b7UbjqLHcEXGA2n0mo1NtxynwZElDfxqaQVAbE/wBH0xZ%2b9a0QhWPnFGrRlDTQ0nHnRVkbK1HrC5r1WqmiIwvhtJbUGlvnne6gbC33OJvivkCJlWDS6nR5T79OnXTpfsVoVpChuAAQRfp0x3wlyXTsyRqpU6zImeUp622/Kxti6td7XPTlbDJ8TsvvZly1Eg02EuG/TEKXwZZKVFpLZ0lJI33BB%2bvosOdSK3ihCVEAwSNhiczHG0xOYqwc%2bncaFub7CP3%2bd/as9ZeqjcJ15qUlSoshOhzTzHYjBLHepMdzzKqqt9N9QbVcknmLjqQe%2bAAbYlMYyt1F1WknemG26gWEpCm0r05TqBx37ESJzBmrqqzlVOcp4JITbShPYDEHQriJSUquSBbkTvi2y0wh%2bSQsXGD%2bm5ahTqtTGXQpKXJLKCU7EArSNsGbi5Sw2GhtFDX7hTrynHTKlGSeTTbz5kBFI8L5NIm%2bWRT2Iq5MdTJVqYcbSVlJ1E6gSfixlGkVSVSJrcyCsIfQDpKk6gLgi9j132xuP2iWlfhbmGQ24UKYiEAWuCFuJSr7X9cYQ74W7dYdbIPff56VDTWgaZkc1tP2bM1T865XqkmuMQFOQ5qEtqYjhBJ0hWo9L3O1rYNvFRLYoZeIAcS08ATz08NRP8DCb9k9x2N4fZhfZXpWKk2Btf8AbT/uL/x7zbOpWRVTAlp51x3yKQoWCA62u6tuZGnl88Ahe29r1FHT0pIkYjYCDzx5VotsqSVV/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Tech AMA [Robonomics frontier network, XRT staking, Kusama crowdloan rewards]","path":"/blog/ama-2021-08-04/","date":"August 4, 2021","description":"On Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Robonomics Software Architect Sergei Lonshakov hosted a tech AMA in the Robonomics telegram community.

Before the next wave of auctions, the project’s developers decided to deploy and maintain a functionally identical network.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Not a wild cousin of Kusama\n\nKusama Relay chain is under development and passes all updates using stable versions of Polkadot releases. For example, the current version of Kusama was built on [polkadot v0.9.8](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.8) release.\n\n![Kusama Relay Chain and Polkadot release 0.9.8](./images/Robonomics-Frontier/Kusama-Relay-Chain-and-Polkadot-release-0-9-8.jpg)\n\nFrontier Relay chain will use the same versions of Polkadot releases, which will be implemented by Kusama network in the form of its Relay chain.\n\nTo connect to Frontier Relay chain, you can use Substrate portal following this link: https://parachain.robonomics.network/ \n\nAfter connecting the Robonomics parachain to the Frontier Relay chain we can have a blockchain that could work in real-time and would be integrated into the Kusama network. It means that we need to overcome any challenges that Kusama parachains will have. All new capabilities that will appear with new Polkadot releases, will be also supported by Robonomics’ parachain.\n\n## XCMP and integration with Kusama parachains\n\nMaybe only one disadvantage today (in 2021), when we are talking about the lifecycle in a Frontier network and not about the main Kusama network, is a lack of integration via [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain#overview-of-xcmp).\n\nBut it does not mean that you cannot execute technical integration tasks and prepare a Robonomics parachain to work with Karura, Moonriver and Khala. It is those three parachains that are interesting for the Robonomics team in terms of integration. We can start maintaining work in a Frontier network with copies of the mentioned projects, but only after release of public documentation and first samples of using Kusama (how to create trading pair on Karura, connect functions of parachain with solidity/ink smart contracts in Moonriver, or to provide data privacy with Khala).\n\nI’m personally expecting that the process of parachains integration would be executed very carefully in the first year, and maybe other projects will also work together in sandboxes and after it transfer integration mechanisms to Kusama network. So, Robonomics could be in the Kusama network right to the moment of active integration between the projects.\n\n## Genesis block of Robonomics parachain in Frontier network\n\nIn the genesis block will be presented XRT balances of exodus participants, crowdloan contributors and open test network collators. This block will be formed only a few days before the parachain launch in a Frontier network. We will announce this update on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) and [Telegram](https://t.me/Robonomics_ann).\n\nWe are expecting that the genesis block will be formed during the period from 28th to 31st of July.\n\nImportant information for XRT holders in the Ethereum network: To participate in the parachain’s genesis block and participate in staking, you can use dapp exodus till 28th of July. After 28th of July the opportunity to transfer XRT tokens into Ethereum to Frontier will still be available. But this process will be executed by the technical committee of the network and not more often than once a week.\n\nAlso we would like to notice, that the exodus would not allow you to go back till the moment when Robonomics parachain will be connected to the Kusama network, and when there will be suitable bridge to Ethereum. The situation is ~ similar to the process of transfer to Ethereum 2.0 for ETH holders.\n\n## XRT staking\n\nXRT staking in Robonomics parachain aims to split the capacity between two options of payments: for transaction or for subscription. You can read more about this in the article [“RWS overview, part 2 “Heterogeneous tokenomics”](https://blog.aira.life/rws-overview-part-2-heterogeneous-tokenomics-afc209cc855) on Medium.\n\nThe basis of reward for the staking will be ~ 10%. This amount helps to launch the parachain. In the future, the reward will be determined by [Democracy pallet](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/pallet_democracy/) for XRT holders. \n\nCrowdloan contributors will get increased reward rate — 50%. Thus, it will help us to test the mechanism: “Parachain, which always wins”, which will propose adaptive reward for staking Robonomics to the reward for staking in Kusama / Polkadot relay chain and considering XRT price to KSM/DOT. We will explain later in detail about this mechanism and after a few tests. \n\nStaking will be available from the update 1.1 in Frontier network. Please note that tokens transfer in parachain will be turned off on the start, similar to the launch of the Polkadot Relay chain.\n\n## Roadmap - Life after auction\n\nRegardless of that we did not win a slot — the roadmap of parachain development won’t change. Below you will find our plans that were published in the article: https://robonomics.network/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/.\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 1: Establishing core functionality\n\nIn 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n* **Genesis state: (0 week)** Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.\n* **Update 1.1** Staking and allowing transfers (3 - 4 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for all token holders and 50% for Crowdloan participants.\n* **Update 1.2** Treasury and Technical committee (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n* **Update 1.3** RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n* **Update 1.4** Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n* **Update 1.5** XCMP functionality and Robobank (11 - 12 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n* **Update 1.6** Democracy and Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D\n\n2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.\n\n* **Globally available digital passports of products** By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.\n* **Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics** We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries. The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n* **Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits** It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n* **Fault-tolerant civil sensors network** A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.\n* **Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas** It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n* **Ecosystem integration updates** We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain. This is our vision of the future of Robonomics, as a complete segment of the Polkadot infrastructure specifically prepared for working with IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\" imageSize=\"big\" alignContentV=\"middle\">\n\n#### EnsRationis\n\nRobonomics network architect\n\nelement: @ensrationis:robonomics.network\n\n</Card>\n\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.62c183a.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.9ea8d39.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 480w","/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.6b2ed88.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.62c183a.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-c500a3a46c2e1383ad9128ddf93beeb6'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-c500a3a46c2e1383ad9128ddf93beeb6)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bPZ%2bNUV66/8ARGnQ5D9QXKKXmFMAPb2gENG5sCSeokXNgLWGTrn1a/aqhNcaoVPlNylvlDTTKy826L2G1JG8E4sLnQNQ7pVRJbiKQuGacxJ5smWW1tN3QWj3JIwf7x8jWpJi0cSkIQiMGgltKnNi7J6hcnySPJHfxqjw%2bpEeUxDLU1qaXVB8F1LXSMbQVDpOCDfW81%2bzyIRUy/M2OJSHEGQjIGbHo8Ht60SONhgzaASOffKpzNcJMi4gKFa4fp8ymS36aYrJYW4/zG0qSlxOMAKNwMYHi%2bfhAGnxEp%2bXDFPpTdRmR5CnU8oOpdKlAZVZOex7kZ0kOMOMuraeQpt1BKVIULFJGCCPB1XtkjsWCjXCmlEjchI699l0KhmNG2lUdt7Yb8tZO0/e3fVPiQpkblEJDilFRCQAB9h40K%2bgSMpOtrAtdmCn6Z7XQGLEcV%2bk78H/AFA4cpsVqFUqAqnKSWiqbTFkqWUKuCtCyb3uQcm4JGsPjVXDNLdVVOAuJ3%2ba8/zBA/TLQWAb5DhAGOw85xpImjr0Knspk1COyv8AgtYB%2b2l2bxgbMHRSOAJ/G7B/oEjc9EJWlcIsj6TDwvwfP4meS/JdcbaduUOL61um%2bbXP3yfWn9z6asQYTyBDn7XAlKlKcsL/ANDPr1rCbqzke3JbQhA7ITcJA9D41VqXFkshIDaRtP8AkXY%2bvPjTlpPCtZVAE939pRll1Wqk2diOgPpWoUWfwJX2qjQkmPLeCmmWJqAtDqTa4CsZB22v%2bdIdUlSahVJcueSZb7qnHbi3UTnVyoVB2c4FuixH%2byj/ANJ0OpnnNRZBSkOLQUKIH8inG4/NrfjXcvhdPp3jURtpx2K1YsmEBxsntf/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Crowdloan unveils plan B to win with plan A","path":"/blog/kusama-crowdloan-guaranteed-rewards/","date":"July 2, 2021","description":"Risk-free contribution in Robonomics Crowdloan announcement.

For four years, in parallel with the Parity developers, we studied the future network architecture, tried early developments of the Substrate framework and prepared the Robonomics parachain for launch with one goal - to create a vertical in the Polkadot ecosystem that will be machine-friendly.\n\nRobonomics team consists of robotics engineers, academic researchers, and software developers. We are one of the few who have been studying the possibilities of Bitcoin, Ethereum, IPFS and Polkadot for communication between people and automated services connected to the Internet for seven years. We want to see smart cities of the future today, but we don't wish these cities of the future to be smart concentration camps for people watching you and can get access to your house, car, or pacemaker without your permission. \n\nI am sure that the only alternative for total control is the p2p economically significant interaction, so the IoT platform we are developing is called Robonomics.\n\nBy winning a parachain slot in the Kusama network, we will open the doors for hundreds of IoT developers to the Polkadot ecosystem and help them take their first steps under the guidance of experienced teachers and roboticists. Most IoT developers we interviewed are happy to try an alternative to the usual corporate clouds, but it simply does not exist today. Almost every engineer we know understands the problems associated with client-server solutions. However, today there is still no environment that a corporation does not manage and at the same time produces user’s trust.\n\nPolkadot is a trust-free ecosystem, and Robonomics is a way to connect smart devices under its control. Contribute to its development. We offer up to 5 XRT per 1 KSM to early supporters who bonds the first 35,000 KSM. The proposed reward makes Robonomics Crowdloan more profitable than stacking in Kusama Relay Chain at the current rate by more than two times.\n\nWe’ll announce the launch of the Robonomics Crowdloan campaign on [the Robonomics Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) account in the coming hours.\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Read the terms of participating in the Robonomics crowdloan campaign in the blog:\n\n[https://robonomics.network/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/](/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Participate in the crowdloan through the dedicated page:\n\n[https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot](/kusama-slot)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### You can also always use the standard interfaces from parity:\n\n[https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\" imageSize=\"big\">\n\n### Welcome to our journey!\n\nEnsRationis\n\nRobonomics network architect\n\nelement: @ensrationis:robonomics.network\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.62c183a.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.9ea8d39.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg 480w","/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.6b2ed88.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/crowdloan-letter-from-Robonomics-co-founder_blog.62c183a.4cd8392bc0a4d674c5613effed73983c.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-4ad3c9a39399fbd946f97d535a8cc506'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-4ad3c9a39399fbd946f97d535a8cc506)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQYHBAII/8QALxAAAQMCBQIGAQMFAAAAAAAAAQIDBAURAAYSITETQQcUIlFhcYEVMpEWQlKSof/EABoBAAEFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAQIDBQf/xAAqEQABAwMDAwMEAwAAAAAAAAABAgMRBCFBAAUxElFhBnGxExQjkTKB8f/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AOxvCx6C4VuVSC4FDQEvMKI%2bxvzjTIyJ0JLEd2RSEuyLpbHlVdhzztiiQPMVwymnabLp6Y7pSlT9iXU8ahbYDfbn59sAMxUiR/VbKy68rrBIYATcWHIB7Ecm/vf4xp0RVUVDiHLJAse5z%2btNuvrDeKanS8hfUsm46U8WjGfnS254drXJDfnaQl0i/STHI2tbi/wCccxPBd3fzlQfPt0IxN/5O33hnzNVqLl6pxpk5TjtTWAlphs7quQkq9hz3P0MO1cTBFQUqTNk9QWPl9akoF9B5CT/gP9le%2bK3nC3Ya0ab1DvS2g4twpSrg9KbxzFsakbvg48y%2bhyNPUppBuRJikX/g4xSsrNQnZDLrkFwMhIffRTnFtsbA%2bpQNgbWJ5sDc2xYoDcCBBmz25c10txHFLZcdUtKUjc2uBc7WvieRJ6KzImyaHJS1S5LIRIcdBUtlTmpTitF7JskJF1bDbnCac6xJxoxrfNzVK3XSUDMJAmRnpN44EfEaWp%2bVINOQ%2b07VKKt9KVDpJaUpwEgmwGrY77X%2bMI9MynLeml%2bp1dmNCKkIjpjR3HEOa9gpa1BPHsLj2vg7V89UJFSdms0N6TSCsN9VUlxKnUgBOoIChYEJHIN/zit5agZfqMGBU8v0yC7AkoDjT4ZGofG9yCCCPsYtMiDqxz1K6w2lSnVqVmPpgSMGOo/0dbs01%2boQ8lUOXGWqPIkuIS6tCdaUpP7r9wPnCtU8zVCnlM9t52cpTejpBKVA2BIseb7kH8YVv1SeqbU4rsyQ5Hj%2biO2twlDOpei6UnbhRwYjp0VNxCFKShKQ2oXvrsAQo/Pqtf7/AA7FK%2bwn8vSoZgEHzfjEgQO065%2b7UoWQbza2DEYtzruPCkViJTG6zpVKW%2b06%2bpXKvVcgW2G222KJVc3UOMuot1BaFTorCXn2UOFJCCbJJuQE8jvtcHuMJDbi0OocQQFN2UNu98Zqu6KtKMaWyxpmMqakOIbCXHEAgpTrG9gd7YD3agrXK1p1lQDSQAoE837R28i/jR1DuKVoU0sRJKgBwJ5%2bPNtUNUqDLokg0xrS3MiqBUtZUSlafs%2b%2bJVAjuQMsPxWWI0aSGnGHlFdkuJsQpRIFydJv34wbpc%2bVDakwmlo8vHKGWwUeoI6Y9N%2b/H/cEIOW4dWgOT3nJCHo6rpShdklO10kW735wPtzdTtqKio3FcpP8YwADNreO/vqdXVF9SaamHBBUCYBj/TjXnNvKlXjUdMGZqSuQrWwlKCUO3ub9T9vAvcm%2b/GLXkGtVbLmTKdR2qdEeWxFC21peJAJUVHV73Ctvfm5wqeJstapUOCEoRFbb6iEJFgP7QPoAYdsoZdad8P28wuyn1Tlp0gE%2bgJSvRa3fYD6tgvbar7inTU1CbkWA97CbYGdLcyVJCKZATF1GT2uYM/oa/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Crowdloan final parameters and 48 weeks roadmap","path":"/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/","date":"June 28, 2021","description":"Robonomics Developers publish the KSM crowdloan module on June 28th.

It’ll allow competing for the 3rd slot.** At the moment, PLO auction participants bid around 25,000 - 30,000 KSM for the 5th slot\n* **For each KSM bonded, you’ll get 3.5 XRT on the horizon of 48 weeks.** Based on the current XRT and KSM price, Robonomics crowdloan offer outperforms Kusama Relay Chain staking by x1.5\n* **1.725 XRT will be unlocked within the first month** after the Robonomics parachain launch\n* **KSM bonders will get the entire reward in one year of XRT staking** with an increased APR of up to 100%\n* **Distribution of the crowdloan rewards will happen in Robonomics parachain. There won’t be an option to get rewards in ERC-20 XRT**\n\n## Bonuses\n\n* **Robonomics crowdloan won’t provide any referral bonuses**\n* **Increased reward for the first 35,000 KSM collected.** Get 5 XRT instead of 3,5 in one year\n* **Extra reward for [Robonomics Polkapet NFT](https://opensea.io/assets/0x8cb813bf27dc744fc5fb6ba7515504de45d39e08/24) holders, who’ll bond the first 35,000 KSM.** Get 6 XRT instead of 3,5 XRT in one year.\n\n## Most important to know\n\nRobonomics developers are early adopters of Polkadot. We understand that the current technical implementation of the Kusama Relay Chain and Substrate framework may contain errors and be reviewed this or next year. The participants of the crowdloan campaign need to keep that in mind.\n\nBesides, the entire Polkadot ecosystem is establishing now, this process may take an indefinite time. Don’t forget this whenever studying any plans of developers.\n\nThis is a grand experiment, ladies and gentlemen.\nYou want to participate in it at your own risk.\n\nWelcome to our journey!\n\n## Roadmap - Life after auction\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Part 1: Establishing core functionality\n\nIn 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n* Genesis state: (0 week). Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.\n* Update 1.1: Staking and allowing transfers (3 - 4 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for token holders and 100% for Crowdloan participants.\n* Update 1.2: Treasury and Technical committee (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n* Update 1.3: RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n* Update 1.4: Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n* Update 1.5: XCMP functionality and Robobank (11 - 12 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n* Update 1.6: Democracy and Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D\n\n2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.\n\n* Globally available digital passports of products. By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.\n* Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics. We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries.  The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n* Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits. It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n* Fault-tolerant civil sensors network. A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.\n* Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas. It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n* Ecosystem integration updates. We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain.

Becoming one of Kusama's parachains is a good way to provide access to your Substrate project within the Polkadot ecosystem, implement currently unavailable Blockchain network security to small projects, as well as initiate the integration process with other ecosystem projects as soon as possible. The goal of Robonomics for 2022 is to become a fully functioning conductor of IoT projects to the Polkadot ecosystem. This is why all of the aforementioned benefits of launching a Kusama network are important to us. And in general, our strategy has [already been published](/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/) a long time ago - \"Kusama first, while Polkadot is a vision\". In this post, we’ll dissect the use of the Cowdloan module in detail and take a look at the parachain update plan after launching. \n\n## Kusama crowdloans have started!\n\n*Dr. Gavin Wood, June 8, 2021, [Kusama Parachain Auctions](https://polkadot.network/kusama-parachain-auctions/):*\n\n> The following is the case assuming that no significant and unexpected issues are found with the relay-chain logic. (In such a case, all options should remain on the table for network governance, including pausing or postponing any scheduled or ongoing auctions.)\n\n**Preliminary schedule of auctions:**\n\n- 2021/06/15, 12:00 GMT: First Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences. Bids may be placed.\n\n- 2021/06/22, 12:00 GMT: Second Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/06/29, 12:00 GMT: Third Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/07/06, 12:00 GMT: Fourth Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\n- 2021/07/13, 12:00 GMT: Fifth Kusama Parachain Slot auction commences.\n\nPolkadot allows parachains to source tokens for their parachain bids in a decentralized [crowdloan](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crowdloans). Once a crowdloan campaign is open, anyone can participate by sending a special transaction that references the campaign's index. Tokens used to participate must be transferable — that is, not locked for any reason, including staking, vesting, and governance — because they will be moved into a module-controlled account that was generated uniquely for this campaign.\n\nFour projects who launched their KSM crowdloan campaigns (Kurara up to 1,5 mln KSM, Shiden up to 1 mln KSM, Crust up to 1 mln KSM, Moonriver up to 1 mln KSM)  to collect resources for leasing the parachain slot on Kusama during the parachain lease offering auctions. \n\nRobonomics Dev DAO aims to bid an exact amount of KSM needed for securing a third-fifth parachain slot. Thus, the crowdloan module will be launched right after the end of the auction for 2nd slot on Kusama.\n\n## Estimated time of the Robonomics crowdloan launch is 28 June\n\nYou’ll be able to participate in the Robonomics crowdloan through the [dedicated page](/kusama-slot).\n\n**Before participating in the crowdloan, double-check that the campaign is live [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).**\n\n## How to participate in the Robonomics Crowdloan \n\nBy default, Polkadot developers provided a native interface in the [Substrate portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan)\n\n![Crowdloan on Polkadot portal](./images/kusama-crowdloan-details/crowdloan-on-polkadot-portal.png)\n*Example of the Crowdloan page on June 11th, 2021*\n\nAt the start of April, Robonomics practised participating in auctions by using the Crowdloan module on the Rococo network. You can check out this Twitter thread to familiarize yourself with the standard interface for community participation in [Polkadot auctions](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1377653645827833860)\n\nAlso, it’s worth mentioning that on the official [Robonomics site](/kusama-slot), functionality for interacting with the Crowdloan module will be made available.\n\n<!-- ![How to participate in Robonomics Crowdloan on Kusama](./images/kusama-crowdloan-details/crowdloan2.gif) -->\nThis is what Crowdloan participation will look like on the Robonomics site after June 28th. \n\nInstructions on how to use the Crowdloan interface module through the Robonomics website will be published closer to the start of the third auction. \n\n## Popular questions amongst the community\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Why does Robonomics participation start only from the third round?\n\nDevelopers could publish the Crowdloan module today, but then we would have to implement limits. As can be noticed, the first 4 projects that published their Crowdloan modules established a 1 million KSM token limit. \n\nWe’re placing our bets on 100,000 KSM being enough to win one of the Kusama network auctions, but are also reserving space for ourselves to quickly adjust the limit if we come to understand that more KSM tokens will need to be collected by the conclusion of the first and second rounds. In general, we’re trying to manoeuvre in search of an optimal rental cost for a slot.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### What will happen if Robonomics doesn’t win the 5th auction? \n\nTo be honest, we don’t have a plan B. [We'll be like Schwarzenegger](https://youtu.be/Ri-M_Vo3w5A).\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Will it be possible to participate in the Robonomics crowdloan through exchanges? \n\nSome well-known exchanges like Kraken and Okex are already providing crowdloan support for their users. A list of relevant exchanges that support interaction with the Crowdloan module will be provided on the Robonomics website at the start of the 3rd auction.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### What will happen in 48?\n\nIf after 48 weeks the project will once again be unsuccessful in winning an auction, then the parachain will turn into a [parathread](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parathreads#docsNav). However, developers have already published preparation plans for future slot auctions: here’s a publication from October 26th, 2020, [Robonomics Parachain Lease Offering, On-chain Governance Strategy](/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/). But, we also have a secret plan concerning the development of an algorithm to be built into the Robonomics protocol, which will autonomously generate beneficial bonding terms for KSM/DOT holders that will also benefit Robonomics. In general, we contemplate over medium-term issues in advance and continue to think about important matters such as maintaining Robobomics in the state of a parachain today.\n\n</Card>\n\n## Life after auctions\n\nA parachain comes to life inseparably from the moment auction results are concluded. But for a project, this doesn’t indicate that work is over. Remember how the Polkadot Relay Chain launched? The Robonomics team is contemplating over an analogous launch form, increasing functionality accessible to a user in steps. \n\n## Robonomics will start its existence with the following possibilities: \n\n- XRT transfers between balances\n\n- Launch of IoT devices using XRT for paying transaction fees \n\n- Sending IoT device telemetry using XRT for paying transaction fees \n\n- Sudo\n\n- A technical committee\n\n## Further update plan\n\n- Genesis state: Core functionality (0 week). Launch of the above set of functions.\n\n- Update 0.1: Staking (1 - 3 week). Will allow you to stake your XRT with a 10% APY for token holders and 125% for Crowdloan participants. \n\n- Update 0.2: Treasury (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. \n\n- Update 0.3: RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments but a monthly subscription as well. \n\n- Update 0.4: Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices. \n\n- Update 0.5: Robobank (11 - 12 week). You can read about Robonomics in this article:\nhttps://robonomics.network/blog/robobank-introduction/ \n\n- Update 0.6: Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee. \n\n- Ecosystem integration updates (before the end of the year). Further, we will focus attention on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in what Polkadot can do. \n\nStay tuned and follow our updates [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics)\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.62c183a.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.9ea8d39.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.6b2ed88.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robonomics-crowdloan-on-kusama.62c183a.83148b9b3769673eb5be73ad555f23b8.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-7d699c7cb809c42c03af7eb60dcec7e6'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-7d699c7cb809c42c03af7eb60dcec7e6)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUGAwcA/8QAKxAAAgECBQIFBQEBAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABRIhMQYTFEFRYXEVIjKBwZGh/8QAGQEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgUDBAYH/8QAKhEAAQMCBAQGAwAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEEiExQQUTUWEGcYGRoeEUI/D/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AIynpqWSGEyVDRkyhZXsCqIRsQPyJvztbAcoRZXWJ%2b5GGIV7W1DyOPTTxQVFPD4VqmSZiFRGIOw9gTbe%2b2%2b3I3OMKha6CvlEtLNHTPGzwmcaTIwPEfJKgHzJ%2bcbRHFUN3v46lE4tAY3z01PTWI2yk1jwwqtlXMxhygDI%2bsz8R3k1sqszAKCSTYAYeUuQTd6LvfcSReJBqYn0wJl2S1tfTiejhqZo76S8VHM4UgXIuB5X3/3DmSlzwUqxDLa6VwpJfw0ysdvX%2bj1wzcvmgYxUhum3yBycuv1SGeiEZkGohhbQmk3be3OA2VlYqwIYbEEcYffSM4qYVaqy2thkdS13o52N%2bbXtY%2bYv84U5ll9bltKZq2nmgJv2llp5E7pB4BItwQcGi9ZWqEqk/wBpUrSHEp/ZQoUlgAGJJtYYJraCpoSgq4miZr2ViL/seXONMtoM6rqSvqMmimkpIY7VLpYAKPusb/F9vTCWaWpB1StJdt7tycGlxRdKZED3%2bvmp8IwyJmu3UPSL5XQQpn0EUUMUbSa42GubWL6gy7jTY/qwttiY6Z7ueZjPldHTCvlnR0pzO2plTVe7FthZbWta3zii6W6rPVWVVWW55RJKtOkatJFIYzIN7A24/Ecc4oumsqyrLsxirsoofB1MdwG7pfYj0OOe3qF8MuH%2bIXkEpAIAGQAG2epJ6j2q8h5xbAtG3FYVa6b%2bkZeVcs%2buZ/0fUVGTQzpA1LPKHRokezMArEEjggDBVF1nnlRU9iaaAPI4LBqaMXbyO42PGF3W9fLmfVOaV04UPNUMCoGw0MFH6IXj3wJkJo4qsT5hSvV08RQGBZjFr%2b7a7AE2BN9t/cYfKvLNxAdLCVKIkkgan0rS2ng68vGOcp3Ak6RmT8gCfOnld13nyt2YqqJhEunamjsg1Xtx6n/uE2a9S5tnMcCVtQjLTszxBIUQKWADHYewxpVR09XJ4rsiDvOD2YbLGguW0qLbAH5973wHFBF4mRG1lFKxjcauGNybW8vTE1q7YqVhLCUk9hvl03obzwtd8Pb54dxpTrsR39%2b9AzV1YkLxLOyo/wCeg21fNtjhb2nkcM12F7Ek4oKqlgDsqiSwAO7D39sC1tNFTdsRa7NcnUQf4MPmG2mhDaQPIVk7hwrM4pr/2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Kusama Parachain Lease Offering, April 2021","path":"/blog/kusama-parachain-auction/","date":"April 17, 2021","description":"Robonomics rewards the Kusama Parachain auction participants!","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\nimport Button from '~/components/Button.vue'\n\n<div class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## 1 KSM = 1 XRT\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"text_abstract layout layout__text animate post_abstract in-viewport animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\nEvery participant will be rewarded with XRT\n\n</div>\n\n> The most relevant information is available here: https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot\n\n- Get rewards: per 1 KSM contributed, 1 XRT is rewarded\n- XRT for now is available on Uniswap, Huobi, and in addition on PancakeSwap\n- Receive increased staking of 125% return for the next 48 weeks\n- Quick rewards option: 25% right after the win, 75% after the successful launch of the Robonomics parachain (est. 2-4 weeks)\n- Contribute to the future: Robonomics integrates new technologies into the real economy \n\nCrowdloan limit: 100,000 KSM\n\nRobonomics will participate in 3rd-5th slot auctions to win.

For example, it allows Polkadot users to [pay vending machines or robots in any token of the Polkadot ecosystem](https://robonomics.network/blog/robobank-introduction/).\n\nRobonomics is a project with a long history that started in 2015, after the launch of the Ethereum network. During the project’s development, the team published more than [10 academic articles](https://robonomics.network/community#science) and created more than [15 R&D projects](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/r-and-d-based-on-robonomics-network/) which included control of drones, industrial manipulators, sensor networks, and even a Boston Dynamics’ robot dog over Ethereum and Polkadot networks.\n\nRobonomics is a project that integrates new technologies into the real economy. However, to fuel this, a reasonable ‘gas’ price is required. Kusama makes the costs of communication between IoT devices and humans affordable.\n\nKusama Auction mechanics: [https://kusama.network/auctions](https://kusama.network/auctions)\n\nParachain Crowdloans: [https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/mirror-learn-crowdloans](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/mirror-learn-crowdloans)\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n![\"Robomomics Parachain on Kusama wallpaper\"](./images/Kusama-Parachain-auction/wallpaper_KUSAMA_6.jpg)\n\n</section>\n\n**Community, support our auction** 🦾\n\nRobonomics Developers DAO\n\nStay tuned: [https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics)\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.62c183a.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":676},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.9ea8d39.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 480w","/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.6b2ed88.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/Kusama-Parachain-auction.62c183a.d640fd202672229383344861461f1f17.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 676' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-453990b58408de3788085e78a03e644a'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-453990b58408de3788085e78a03e644a)' width='1500' height='676' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bM%2b%2bpFv2wUG7dl3C03fzBTVCeqEZdWVupSuRyQQOD37arnwq8O7RsGovV4a519%2buholjYzU/QEgbDBAuTknAyc8Y9udCWAOUnzMIZQhLa7S2LheqekMYUGYuvWPLII6fY506hq0qqFamnJKsMjI5HPPGohZZDuhpXjNPAlMFhM1I3XGTj0DIHK/17Eal1NTpbqBYYeVQd29yTydTqHPDGVFrAcL26fXe999I1%2bFwlK%2breOiwDKDnLduNCrEzMp9IAI40nCF4%2bo/Vk9I%2beNIOTKycYAB1SiImYCVVxyQedML9WtarRXV6KJGiTrCMcA410sDIOORoJ4Y6iJop0WSNhhlYZB0SEBgWFxMYEg2lUyeKNerKBZ4ehv5ea2MfPA0yqPFSpSBohaKBo8Y8vqkwf6x041abbfs7eq2UR%2b8K/jWs7YsTeqz28/enX8aqczgT8PXvEKlYatKL274nybdoZqe32emWOadpiHnlYl27kfR2OMgaxW/qCu9MZM7YpniT/J%2b5cKR88rq8TtPbx72O2H70yfjQnZ22z3sFqP%2bon40a4vw8a0ep/YeV9zNWwr6%2b6toWi%2bSwrTvVxeaYkYsF5Ixn37a74YGVlxyADnQUVJT0NLHTUcEUFPGMJFEoVVHwAO2t2BknHJ99SajKzkqLDaME//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}}]}}},"context":{}}
