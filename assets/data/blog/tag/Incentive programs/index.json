We‚Äôre not going to build anything autonomous in the frontier network.\n\nAfter Robonomics parachain will connect to Kusama, the frontier network will become something like Rococo/Westland - a test network required for experiments before releasing anything in the mainnet.\n\n**In the upcoming 2 months we will focus on building the newcomers‚Äô onboarding process clear and understandable.** This is always the task of the pioneers.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nWhat‚Äôre your thoughts on the past PLO Kusama auction?\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nI‚Äôm positive about the outcome of the summer PLO auctions. Together, we proved that projects without the eminent VCs support and a huge ton of money have a place in the crypto-world.\n\nA small team of hard-working developers doing their thing can build one of the TOP-10 projects in the Polkadot ecosystem! We didn‚Äôt get involved in multi-million pledges with big KSM bags offering them better terms rather than to the community, and we‚Äôre ready to compete in the next round of PLO!\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nWhen can we expect the launch of Robonomics parachain in the frontier network?\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\n**We finalized the genesis block of the Robonomics parachain** at the end of the previous week. **Rewards** of the participants of the exodus, summer crowdloan of the Parachain ID = 2077 and collators of the public test network **were included in the Genesis block**!\n\n- In total there‚Äôre: 996 accounts\n- Kusama‚Äôs block number used for the snapshot: 8,421,663\n- Ethereum‚Äôs block number used for the exodus participants snapshot: 12,936,339\n- Public test net‚Äôs block number used for the collators rewards snapshot: 253,092\n\n**Robonomics DevOps team lead by [Akru](https://github.com/akru) is working on launching Robonomics frontier network**. If there‚Äôre no issues, we‚Äôd see the launch of the network by the end of this week.\nI‚Äôm waiting for updates from the team, follow Robonomics [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/) account to stay updated!\n\nYou can track the progress at http://parachain.robonomics.network/ (In the parachain dropdown menu you‚Äôll have to choose parachain ID = 2077)\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nWhen will you distribute the rewards of the summer crowdloan campaign?\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nThey‚Äôre included in the genesis block of the Robonomics frontier network. It means they‚Äôll be available right after the launch of the network. **I‚Äôd like to highlight that you had to participate in the crowdloan campaign before the end of the auction for the 5th slot in the 8,421,663 block in Kusama.**\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nWhen we‚Äôll be able to stake XRT?\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nTechnically staking is ready to be deployed. In the upcoming 2 weeks we‚Äôre going to test the staking mechanism on Mercury parachain. **If everything works, community will be able to stake XRT in 3-4 weeks after the 1st block in Robonomics frontier network.**\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nWhich functions will be available after the launch of the frontier network?\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\n**In the first month users will be able to launch IoT devices and gather telemetry data using XRT for paying the network commission.** It‚Äôll allow us to start the migration process of the previous R&D projects to parachain 2077. \nBesides, all XRT token holders will be able to spend tokens for test.\n\n- Fee for launching IoT devices will be:  ~0.0001 $\n- Fee for sending telemetry data will be: ~0.0005 $\n\nIt should be a suitable price for IoT market services versa IoT clouds.\n\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nSo could I pay MerkleBot's Spot in XRT for using it?\n\n</Card>\n\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nIn the time of frontier network yes, after launching in Kusama - Spot rent scheme will be more complex.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\n**Is Robonomics going to participate in the next PLO auction in Kusama?**\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nOf course yes, Plan B doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôll refuse to join Kusama. Plan B opens a path for us to keep building the project. **We‚Äôre waiting for the next wave of auctions and think that sooner they commence is better than later.**\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nWill Robonomics participate in the PLO auction in Polkadot if they commence earlier than the next wave on Kusama?\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Sergei:\n\nNo, **our strategy in the Polkadot ecosystem is** the same - **Kusama first**, while Robonomics Relay chain on Polkadot is the vision.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nThank you, Sergei!\n\nWe covered most of the questions from the community.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Yakub-Sheikh.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\">\n\n### Yakub:\n\nRe: NFT Pioneer card - \n\nDevs are still deciding whether we'll issue the Robonomics parachain's pioneer NFT on Ethereum or Kusama Relay chain. \n\nPioneers, we'll keep you posted ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nAlso, don't miss the live interview with Vitaly Bulatov, CEO of MerkleBot.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX24V99GeW4\n\n</Card>\n\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-notification.png'\" :link=\"'https://t.me/robonomics'\">\n\n### Join Robonomics telegram community\n\nStay updated, ask your questions, discuss robotics and IoT future!\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/AMA-2021-08-04.62c183a.251e6c334b6e7416d33611db54c57380.jpeg","size":{"width":1500,"height":838},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/AMA-2021-08-04.9ea8d39.251e6c334b6e7416d33611db54c57380.jpeg 480w","/assets/static/AMA-2021-08-04.6b2ed88.251e6c334b6e7416d33611db54c57380.jpeg 1024w","/assets/static/AMA-2021-08-04.62c183a.251e6c334b6e7416d33611db54c57380.jpeg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 838' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-cbca6528afc215aafb136ea98eb6cb0d'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-cbca6528afc215aafb136ea98eb6cb0d)' width='1500' height='838' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAkAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAQQDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQAEBgcCAwgB/8QAMxAAAgEDAwIEBAUDBQAAAAAAAQIDBAURABIhBjETQWFxFCJRgQcVFjKRIyShJVKCwdH/xAAZAQADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgQDAAX/xAApEQABAwEFBwUAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDEQQSITGxE1FhcYHS8EJSocHR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDn%2b0UYr7hDA0sEKM2DJO%2b2NfVj9Na3o0R3SWphjZWK4bJzjzyAQdFul6K1XCOeC6XNrbL4sYilZx4YBDbiVxk42qO4/cM6fVdhsSw0YXqeCaVqlElbACLC23LjkkFctwRk/QHvdeaBSizLXE1qoq9ND5VsB/4t/wCawamh%2bb%2b9hyM8bW5/xqe/pfov5Gfq9RGZBvwAWEe98sBt5Ph%2bHhe%2b4t5AaryeNYqp4vFWREkK%2bJHyGAONw%2boPfSFwONNV10%2b7T8Tg2%2bZbXHXnHgu%2bwcHv79vt31hQ0ktZULDAuXP1OAPfVuWw0Nt/CKpqaiGKddpNOlZGrGUM2Fyq8qCc4%2bbI7551ErI9tlEMsFC1HJIWJ2Ss6A9hjdyB/PfWcrxG0ObjX455ICQ4pqelNtOv%2boQ/FHnwthwPv/Hl56CVtHNQztDOAGHmDwfbXQPRMUdKlGZrfbp2kyitK4B8TBOMYPcjufrqsfxdQfrW7BEjj2OheJORG20ZAPbz8tTwWlzpLjlZLDs2B9c8FG7JD4tLLi3RVh8UcmTaw47D008qKJY4nmexIIgCzEVX7Rz6%2b%2bhFuqKaCGU1NE1Qdw2sG2heDx/39vXWcdXbyzmooJ23PwI5CoAwMDHvnSyxyXyQDTr3DReNLHIZCQDTr3jREZbbI8J22JVYg421Hoee/kdDKWCqsNXS3Cut1LVwpJjwKn543OM4YKc45zr2eotbxygUNVE%2bMp/VJHfsft56xauthLGnt8zAvyJJywIwcA49SP40jDM0FtDQ4HlzvFGIzMORPnF5VpWrrvoi9UTUF7tlRZI3p5KYx0pL021235wBkFX%2bYcccjsdBLVYbHP1RSWewdVUtXBOCyz1cJhVW/wBmTgMx8u2oQKu1LPE35ZKMNmRDLweDwB5ckfxp109BaqxjBWU0zSby28VqQgocYXDKQSOft7aWCyFrhRzg0ekkEbs8XYU3/auEm1BDmU84FdBWzo29WqthjMEbxRqQrSxlhnHcEY41RfXS1sPVFyS5y08lc0h8YwuGA%2bgyOO2NGI2lij%2bEkmunwnG2D88VV2%2bYIAI7%2b3A1H75T26kRI6SmljnOCW%2bOSdceeQqjBJ9dVwWURvLyaqmSXaNa3cgSSugwpxyG%2b40Uk6lvDF91czb2Vmyiclf2nt5YGlpapKwTeW/3N6mOoeqZpYzlWKLwfbGNbF6ovKyvKlcyO42krGg454HHHc6WlpCEUIeRpZHkkYs7kszHuSTydbqaaWCQSQSPFIucOjFSMjB5HppaWmC5EEvFzCgC5VwA4AFQ/H%2bdaJppaiQyTyySyHuzsWJ%2b50tLWoRX/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Community incentive program","path":"/blog/community-incentive-program/","date":"November 20, 2020","description":"With the launch of Robonomics Web Services beta test, Robonomics Network is shifting to higher growth pace.

A participant can choose any of the offered paragraphs for acquaintance with the Robonomics Network.\n\n1st wave of participants will be rewarded with **200$ (In the form of native Robonomics token - XRT) for completing the following task**:\n\n* Read step by step instruction in [playground](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/create-account-in-dapp/) section of the wiki;\n* Launch any type of IoT devices or Robotics system in simulation or real;\n* Upload the video on YouTube, in a video participant has to explain:\n    * How does the launch process work with comments + screencast;\n    * How can one store a CPS‚Äôes datalog in Blockchain with the help of IPFS;\n* Make a Tweet and Mention @Aira_robonomics Twitter account and Tag $XRT and #robonomicsnetwork.\n\nIn the Tweet, a participant should share his experience of launching a robot on Robonomics Network.\n\n## Store the global air pollution level in Robonomics Network\n\nRobonomics Network aims to unveil a pollution level by citizens observation networks over the World and help people to offset the carbon footprint. Thus, core DAO developers came up with the [water](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2020.00070/full) & air pollution sensors network, smart buildings offsetting and green certificates.\n\nTo drive the adoption of open-source sensors network based on Robonomics Web Services, the team decided to reward a first 15 participants with **$300 (In the form of native Robonomics token - XRT) for completing the following task:**\n\n* Read step by [step instruction](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/connect-sensor-to-robonomics/) in ‚ÄúCases‚Äù section of the wiki;\n* Connect air pollution sensor to Robonomics & maintain it for more than 1 week;\n* Upload the video on YouTube, in a video participant has to explain:\n   * How does the process of connecting air pollution sensor to Robonomics Network look like + screencast;\n   * How can one store an air pollution level in Blockchain with the help of IPFS;\n* Make a Tweet and Mention @Aira_robonomics Twitter account and Tag $XRT and #robonomicsnetwork.\n\nIn the Tweet, a participant should share geolocation of his sensor and share his experience connecting it to Robonomics Network.\n\n## Making a research/Proof-of-Concept project on Robonomics Network\n\nRobonomics Web Services is an excellent environment for creating your simulations of smart factories, robotics systems and digital twins of IoT devices.\n**If you‚Äôre looking for a source of inspiration, we suggest you visit the Robonomics scientific resources:**\n\n> [Research &
