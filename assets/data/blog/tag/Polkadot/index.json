These use cases describe unique opportunities for the crypto audience and all participants of the IoT market.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\nOur team already has various business cases that are ready to leverage the parachain technology. But before we can roll out these use cases we need to obtain a parachain in the [Kusama Parachain Auctions](https://kusama.network/auctions/). So, letâ€™s talk about each of these current use cases.\n\n## Meet Spot, our Robodog\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_xBLkszEwWk\n\nThis summer, the first group of engineers learned to work with our own Spot as part of the [spot-sdk.education](https://spot-sdk.education) course. By the end of September, anyone, anywhere in the world can take our course and get his hands on with the robodog from [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot). The course is developed by robotics specialists from the [ITMO University](https://en.itmo.ru/) in St. Petersburg and [Merklebot](https://merklebot.com/) acting as the local operator in the San Francisco Bay Area lab, the home of our Spot. \n\nAccessing Spot is organized through the use of two parachains - the Robonomics and Statemine parachains. Logs of the students passing the course will be recorded on the Robonomics Parachain where the [Statemine parachain](https://polkadot.network/statemine-upgrade-launches-new-phase-of-parachain-functionality/) is being used to replace user accounts with unique access tokens that students will receive after payment of their course.\n\n## An Urban Sensor Network on the Volga river\n\nOne experiment that is leveraging the power of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/) based Blockchain technologies is currently taking place in Tolyatti. The focus here is creating an alarm network detecting high levels of air pollution without a commercial focus and being dependent on a government, but solely being supported by the citizens of Tolyatti and the Russian Airalab organization. The automatically collected information on exceeding the level of air pollution will be used for a quick response of the mobile laboratory, which is already capable of conducting a detailed analysis of particles in the air.\n\nAll data collected by the Urban Sensor Network will be securely recorded in the Robonomics parachain to avoid any possibility of intervention in the measurement history and provide security from disabling the network during attacks of the main server. \n\nIt is an example of the social impact the Robonomics project can have in these times where [90% of the world's population breathes dirty air](https://www.bloomberg.org/blog/accelerating-clean-air-action-one-data-point-at-a-time/). Thus, with the help of Kusama we can have a trustable, immutable way of storing pollution data which can be used for science to create a better world for all [protected against corrupted actors on both corporate and government level](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/06/05/corruption-is-a-threat-to-planet-earth/).\n\n<Card>\n\nWatch **a step-by-step process** of how to connect an SDS011 Air Quality Sensor to the Robonomics Decentalized Sensor Network from our Community member\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AQ7ZzgbN7jU\n\n</Card>\n\n## Digital Twins for Smart Leasing\n\nThere is an interesting new use case in Robonomics. For four months already, an industrial manipulator has been operating in a manufacturing facility in the United States with an hourly wage. At the end of each shift, the manipulator updates its digital twin instance stored in the parachain. Based on the changes in the digital twin, an invoice is issued for the use of the manipulator structured as IoT-enabled leasing. \n\nThus, we can say that Kusama will be an example of a fintech solution from web3 for the new industry 4.0. [Someday the public will understand the significance of this use case](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/manufacturing/us-supply-chain-of-the-autonomous-robots.pdf), and we will see a boom of DeFi for this modern industry!\n\n## Digital Passports for IoT systems\n\nTwo projects â€” one is from New Zealand â€” are using parachains for recording data about production manufacturing. In one case, data about the content of substances in the ground on farms is collected, in the second â€” data about the final assembling of medical equipment. \n\nBoth scenarios would help the Kusama network to expose itself as a registry for global production distributors.\n\n<Card>\n\n**Project 1** New Zealandâ€™s premier industry is considered to be Agriculture. Climate change and clean water in our rivers are also at the forefront of New Zealandâ€™s concerns. Luckily, with the advances in precision agriculture and the efficiency of our world-leading practices, our sheep and beef farmers can claim to produce less Greenhouse Gas Emissions to get a piece of meat to a dinner table in London than the comparable farmers in Wales:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGMeYKInAk\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n**Project 2** Demonstration of the work of an automated workstation for video recording of the assembly process and testing of complex technical products.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wmeBIbNaBlQ\n\n</Card>\n\n## Second Wave of Kusama Crowdloans\n\nWe would love to see your support for [Robonomics during its crowdloan](https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot/) for the 6-10th parachain slot on the Kusama network so we can implement each use case as soon as possible!\n\nWhile these use cases are just scratching the surface of the potential that the Robonomics Network will bring to the industry 4.0 after obtaining a parachain slot on [Kusama](https://kusama.network/), they demonstrate the numerous capabilities of Web3 that are not yet being explored or utilized. \n\n*This is only the beginning of Robonomics' Web3 journey, and ultimately we plan to enable millions of interoperable IoT devices in the Polkadot ecosystem, including many of which have not yet been conceived, but are already possible with [the technology of Robonomics](https://blog.aira.life/a-brief-introduction-to-robonomics-9b7884172e77)!*\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-future.png'\">\n\n### Want to be a part of the future?\n\nHead over to the [Robonomics Crowdloan page](https://robonomics.network/kusama-slot/) or the [Kusama Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/parachains/crowdloan) and support us building the infrastructure for the Smart Robotic grid of tomorrow!ðŸ¦¾\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.f40e47ee35e5c8b8f2fdd58d0788c762.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-ab82f7b91d70eeb1933e82d3d64ef8a1'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-ab82f7b91d70eeb1933e82d3d64ef8a1)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bqxKvH%2bPY5H7MtyOVZVg3CsqF6pKb36u2Oicuw3JUcCa0l%2b%2bZt1qQSpR2AGogmdZE/wA9aVITcZS1CUpaRbpKR3wCq9YjwHOQ2lUiYrRLLepv9fT%2b%2bN3VUvD3UfDU8b/AMNf9v1ccNzPDFtpARTqehaVApKac8AD3/Uvr98MLvlkdkEU0/e3Ckw0wsE7lMx4CfXyrPaJCgu8KvSqghlEtJUlwZ1ZgcnRywDqAogHMP3txbAiLGadvzpCWQP5kk3/ABjXfNPDkJQDEhZgDmPl79ibaW%2bb64iKp4c85JXEhFq/UlNPfCiL7A83Q%2b2EL1Q2NGi7cTP2HDP4j3rJ240NE9hEiSVRSRzHGk6pF9dDitJbaTIcEdSlMhRyFQ1I7Xwa4qjtO1SpSqBH5NNW6oxS42oISknpB/7gLGadRHbS%2bUqdCQFlJuL99cSQ%2bcmrG2CX3ZQSRGuogGcGNQobjlTJ4SUabV%2bKVKcQyqCwzmlpd1StC1BvLr3Ocn%2bnGpcUcBUXhutcOz49Tg0ZpL6lPIfuFyG02UbK16gNMvodDgTwA2mn1J2K2AWZqUhwWsQUHMkg%2bu498OHjTSo0qj0Z%2by0kOKASpZWACm/f7YZ4ghm64kLVYjs8tlAj1BHOsgavHktl1Kz5nr6yZ8TXnr5Tzq5NUqiWXJLi3UR47HNcSgkkFewTuNLk/QYvsyk0dk1OnSmZTjgWyyxMp6FhRBF1FJ0SOwO5N7euDK%2bH4iiSb30tYWsR3GIaBF5ocuoKuPx6fbFieEguBf1D8oPdhERy7pPLWZzjIkK%2bI7tbZaUskERlXvH6obw9KkcT1p1ufGgJqa45bpsVlhMeO%2b/e4S4U6gkE22BIAJAwtSplRdddVI5YcUrqyMoFiNCLCwHtjQ6bCTTZ8ebEUEyI7gcbUUBQChsbHfHS5SGFqUVbqUVGw7nFim1YSskIEabf7pUYccvEpCUuqEdTikunzKxNaXBfqbceKLKSHUHIEg3OgBudj%2bcVqtIqkaWmMwqFIaaCQX22coULA%2b%2b%2b51w9%2bSx9P8Ynksf/AEYBVkytwqWJTGIEe9AOLPhBQlZAJkwYknJMZJ55r//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}}]}}},"context":{}}
