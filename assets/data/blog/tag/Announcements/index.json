While our core emphasis is on our hardware this year, we continue to explore multi-agent systems, humanoid robots, and on-chain market mechanisms.\n\n2025 goal is to connect cryptocurrency liquidity with consumer technology and robotics. We invite you to own the physical infrastructure of the 21st century in a secure and trustless way!\n\n![Robonomics Ecosystem](./images/robonomics-trajectory-2025/robonomics-network-hardware-scheme.webp)\n\n## Q1 2025: Expanding Foundations\n\n#### 1. Humanoid Robots R&D\n\nWe're at the forefront of humanoid robotics, one of the first teams to dive deep into this emerging category. Through our work with [startups](https://x.com/vitl2907/status/1887346985361084436) and [developers](https://x.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1883973094949412983), we accelerate the development of real-world applications. We've seen early adoption at [CES](https://x.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1877326334516482452) and other events, running multiple public trials of human-robot interaction in natural environment. In 2025, it will become normal for humanoid robots to serve as hosts, guides, and entertainers. As the technology matures, we'll see broader deployment in senior care, e-commerce warehousing, and hazardous environments like firefighting.\n\nWe’re working with multiple universities and offering a track at [Stanford Tree Hacks](https://www.treehacks.com/), where students will create apps for our Unitree G1 robot!\n\n#### 2. AIRA: Defining Cyber-Physical Agents\n\nWe started [Airalab](https://github.com/airalab) in 2015 exploring multi-agent systems in the context of market mechanisms. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AEmpKReDzE\n\nNow, with AI-driven agents becoming mainstream, we plan to publish a new whitepaper on AIRA, an Autonomous Intelligent Robot Agent. It will outline the latest best practices in robotics development and how they intersect with decentralized market mechanisms—ideas we've refined over the past decade.\n\n#### 3. Hardware for Cyber Punks launch\n\n📍 **ETH Denver 2025**\n\nWe're launching the first device in our Hardware for Cyberpunks lineup: an Altruist Outdoor Sensor. This isn't just a gadget—it's an open-source node in a trustless, citizen-run environmental monitoring network.\n\n- Built on RISC-V (open-source processor)\n- Open hardware & software, fully transparent\n- Native to Robonomics Network & the broader Polkadot ecosystem\n\nAt ETH Denver, we'll showcase this with an interactive NFT-driven onboarding, giving hands-on experience at the Polkadot Demo Day workshop.\n\nWe believe environmental data should be public, trustless, and community-owned—and we've built a device and infrustructure from the ground up to respect these values.\n\n## Q2 2025: Scaling Deployments\n\n#### 1. Robocorporation: The Future of Hardware Funding\n\nWe will release a whitepaper on Robocorporation, continuing our research on [robust market mechanisms](https://robonomics.network/blog/ohf-part-1/) for financing hardware. This paper will define how communities can own and operate hardware and will present our vision of an autonomous governance system where liquidity flows efficiently into new categories of hardware, ranging from small sensors to humanoid robots.\n\nEfficiently directing liquidity into robotics and consumer tech is key to building 21st-century infrastructure rooted in direct ownership and trustless principles.\n\n#### 2. Agentic AI and novel training methods for robots\n\nWe will push further exploring Reinforcement Learning (RL) in robotics and expanding our Polkadot collaborations.\n\nWe've already tested running Llama 3.2 on [Acurast's compute clusters](https://acurast.com/) and have plans to strengthen our collaboration and power even more LLM-based use cases together. Just like we partnered with [Crust Network](https://robonomics.network/blog/robonomics-and-crust-networks-strategic-partnership/) for storage in 2022, we are excited to integrate Acurast distributed compute to use the next-gen, decentralized cloud ecosystem.\n\nThis year we will finally have decentralized storage and compute partners to power humanoid robotics and other resource-constrained edge devices, creating agentic AI ecosystem on Polkadot.\n\n#### 3. Growing Hardware for Cyberpunks\n\nYour home should be your most private space, controlled only by you. Not your keys, not your home!\n\nThat is why we will release Smart Home Server – one of the first RISC-V microcomputers, built for privacy-first smart homes. We deliver open hardware with a fully functioning open cloud support with 3000+ smart home device integrations via Robonomics Network.\n\nWe will also release Hikikomori Tamagotchi Dev Board – a programmable microcontroller that can sign transactions on Polkadot, display data on a built-in LCD screen, be hacked, integrated, and played with like a hardware Tamagotchi for Web3 developers. We're excited to put this in your hands and see how the community brings it to life.\n\nThere will always be custom and complex projects in the physical world, that is why [Pinout](https://pinout.cloud/) is an integral part of our ecosystem, implementing smart apartments, houses, and office buildings. They provide expert consultation on hardware selection, installation, and support for smart home solutions. By working with Pinout, users can deploy complex automation projects with hundreds of devices and have piece of mind that engineers will deliver top notch solution.\n\n## Q3 2025: Decentralized Governance \n\n#### 1. Dawn of Robocorporation\n\nThe most important milestone is pushing forward financing of working capital in hardware businesses. We're moving beyond theory—this is the time to activate real liquidity into hardware ownership. This is the time to build!\n\nOur goal is to allow people to directly fund and co-own physical infrastructure. We're actively exploring real-world asset (RWA) partnerships to bridge the gap between capital and physical infrastructure. If the world of tomorrow runs on robotic automation, it should also be owned by the people who believe in and build it now.\n\n#### 2. Season Pass: Unifying the Robonomics Experience\n\nOver the years, we've minted many NFTs for different experiences—interactions with [robots](https://x.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1887188483308974210), [events](https://robonomics.network/blog/return-to-canvas-art-in-the-world-of-technology/), and even [a telescope](https://robonomics.network/blog/online-winter-school-2022-lesson-telescope/). In 2025 we aim to create a seemless journey across our ecosystem with the launch of Robonomics Season Pass.\n\nOver the past decade Robonomics has become more than just a project—it’s a vision of decentralizing the physical world’s infrastructure. Now, as we push forward, we want to bring together those who recognize the depth of our commitment—pioneers who see trustless physical systems as the key to autonomy. Every season we will release new devices, events and experiences to guide you on the Cyber Punk journey and connect people together. Our open hardware means that it can be assembled anywhere and local governance is critical to build reliable physical infrastructure networks.\n\nThe Season Pass will also make it easier for people to discover, join, and contribute to key projects, such as [FEECC](https://robonomics.network/blog/feecc-recap/) – a blockchain-backed quality control system for manufacturing, and [Otaberu](https://robonomics.network/blog/otaberu-part-1/) – A robotics fleet management system built for the decentralized era.\n\n#### 3. Energy Monitor: final piece of the hardware puzzle\n\nThis will be the most challenging launch in Hardware for Cyberpunks, requiring complex certifications that few companies tackle. But we believe that understanding your energy grid use is critical, and we're offering the most non-invasive solution in the industry to achieve this. This device will let you track, analyze, and connect your grid to Dapps with minimal disruption, setting a new standard for energy monitoring.\n\n## Q4 2025: Hardware Expansion\n\n#### 1. RWA Chip: Embedding Smart Contracts into Everything\n\nThe biggest breakthrough of Q4 is expected to be the launch of our Real-World Asset (RWA) Chip, built on the experience with Hikikomori microcontroller. This chip can sign transactions and be embedded into complex cyber-physical systems like robots and smart buildings. With this we will enable any real-world agent to own, manage, and participate in economic activities autonomously.\n\nImagine a building leasing its own space oa robot earning for its own upgrades—all governed on-chain. This initiative forms the backbone of decentralized equipment leasing, seamlessly integrating into the broader Robonomics ecosystem.\n\n#### 2. Events Roadshow: Bringing DePIN Revolution to Major Cities\n\nWith our hardware ecosystem maturing, we plan to take the movement on the road. We'll launch an events roadshow travelling to major cities to set up hands-on activities where people can see, touch and try devices ranging from smart home devices everybody need to still novel humanoid robots. They’ll learn what it means to own physical infrastructure in a decentralized world, breaking beyond digital networks. Most importantly, they’ll connect with the builders, investors, and pioneers shaping the future of robotic and smart infrastructure.\n\n#### 3. New Devices: AI Smart Speaker & Surveillance-Free Robot Vacuum\n\nWe plan to kick off the holiday season by announcing a new wave of devices, including:\n\n- **Private AI Smart Speaker** – A voice assistant without corporate surveillance, designed for privacy-first smart homes.\n- **Surveillance-Free Robot Vacuum** – A fully autonomous cleaning robot that doesn't spy on you—no hidden data collection, just smart automation.\n- **More devices we're still cooking up** – Expect a lineup of 20+ boundary-pushing tech that fits into our Cyberpunk Hardware vision.\n\nWith this, we'll have a full lineup of open, decentralized consumer devices, proving that privacy and security don't have to be sacrificed for convenience.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nAt this stage, we consider Robonomics Network a complete project. We closely follow [JAM's](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-jam-chain) updates, but our key focus right now is onboarding hardware that will drive demand for Robonomics Network cloud services.\n\nThe physical infrastructure layer is the final piece of the puzzle that we have been assembling for the past 10 years. Our goal is to have open, secure and well-integrated hardware solutions that align with Cyber Punk ideals and run on trustless infrastructure.\n\nRobonomics Hardware is not just building devices: we set the foundation for the physical world.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/webp","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.4474a6693d98fa39c6f5812839368849.webp","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.4474a6693d98fa39c6f5812839368849.webp 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.4474a6693d98fa39c6f5812839368849.webp 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.4474a6693d98fa39c6f5812839368849.webp 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-0168f9635b4b9e024317b3743b9694f1'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-0168f9635b4b9e024317b3743b9694f1)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/webp%3bbase64%2cUklGRkwCAABXRUJQVlA4IEACAACQCwCdASpAAB0APm0ylEekIqIhKAgAgA2JbACuVY3VHhz9wvmzgGFR6YBvGX7olo7xX%2bhPmx1BekAk9IPOzA4hgNxu4PNFCiZhjD/WtbyRgzMl1BhWswrIX5/WIFnZ55d5AQ9vAAD%2b/k90NA8eSVndPpbfZaJ74bYhm/30A/faX7sF/n8/WRpvmVPYmQ6tJ9Aeah35KpZnwk9nS58dVj24MvD9AzaWbH598nX2uE6V9EtXIg7FdAuBe4W%2b6RrAw/TYXwVQm8/lC%2bYQE2nRPrgpzRCgtSnf7k3%2bN1HNlyC9UEGvjgB0fnmlRefjLHY8Wp35ldx0eculP5TZp13jiZJhVUrXYj8sj92d%2bNnTZfRjp4ZRyuXx1%2bvjFdIqLKvggE6PsyP4UyO9BbU6P5Qnrwj7Xm7K0VJkS3IY74pylxKyj90KeLjxoT8dkoxpya398Q1D1/Sm/MgfHW4Rm7CC%2b/4eYyoL6HMpjU%2b6/Mev/3n3fXqHxzftIsmreojEm42gRRHipY1hiQE1RRj6klVrN87M0Zmqw/%2bL4RJeSIWOL3n93A4dtf/QOfvwNL32OOxsrsNu%2bTDtbVNLpP2TlbGfM9E1Dt0huT3QVS9DsprQ9Ivxhqt6vyGCZKoNg78Or5NW0byNmd9wX%2bjmKtQPj/QJYVWJtX40xqB/Nav4HJds46pUnd6VgV0JHmU6Bj90hGrvIMnBB/wsRDn/bhFhaMW%2biw4MUrwf3r1o/avr5xMDg7Sj%2bzOs9mqCrYtMK4KC1RvAAAA=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robo Almanac 2024>>2025","path":"/blog/robo-almanac-2024-2025/","date":"January 12, 2025","description":"An almanac is an annual collection of ideas, events, and achievements that narrate the evolving story of the project.

One of the featured devices is the Hikikomori Tamagotchi—an excellent educational project! By studying how Hikikomori operates, users can learn to send transactions directly from devices costing under $10 to a Web3 cloud. Using interaction examples with the Robonomics or Vara / Gear.exe, users can also gain experience in managing a device's digital twin.\n\nStarting next year, **Gear Protocol** will integrate the Tamagotchi example into **[Gear.exe](https://gear-tech.io/gear-exe) - a bridgless solution designed to supercharge Ethereum dApps** -  and the Hikikomori device will be used in their **University workshop classes** worldwide!\n\n## Hikikomori Overview\n\nThe Hikikomori project combines software and hardware to act as a digital pet integrated with your smart home system, resembling a Tamagotchi but with a twist. Instead of traditional gameplay, it’s linked to your smart home setup through Home Assistant, where each interaction with your home or an automated action increases Hikikomori's \"happiness\" level. This digital pet also connects with the Robonomics and Vara networks, giving it a unique \"soul\" within the Web Ecosystem. Periodically, Hikikomori updates its digital state in Robonomics, with example code available [here](https://github.com/airalab/hikikomori-tamagotchi/tree/only-robonomics/main).\n\n## Integration with Vara Network\n\n**By utilizing [Vara Network](https://vara.network)** - a Layer 1 Blockchain with parallel data processing for deep scalability - **Hikikomori becomes a specialized Tamagotchi**, that **will utilize logic** that calculates its happiness level through computations within a smart contract.

Es ähnelt einem Tamagotchi, hat jedoch eine besondere Note. Anstelle eines traditionellen Gameplays ist es mit Ihrem Smart-Home-Setup über Home Assistant verbunden, wobei jede Interaktion mit Ihrem Zuhause oder eine automatisierte Aktion den „Glücks“-Level von Hikikomori erhöht. Dieses digitale Haustier ist zudem mit den Netzwerken Robonomics und Vara verbunden und erhält dadurch eine einzigartige „Seele“ im Web-Ökosystem. Hikikomori aktualisiert seinen digitalen Status regelmäßig in Robonomics; Beispielcode ist [hier](https://github.com/airalab/hikikomori-tamagotchi/tree/only-robonomics/main) verfügbar.\n\n## Integration in das Vara-Netzwerk\n\n**Durch die Nutzung des [Vara-Netzwerks](https://vara.network)** – einer Layer-1-Blockchain mit paralleler Datenverarbeitung für tiefe Skalierbarkeit – wird **Hikikomori zu einem spezialisierten Tamagotchi**, das **Logik verwendet**, um seinen Glückslevel durch Berechnungen in einem Smart Contract zu ermitteln. Der Tamagotchi-Smart-Contract auf Vara, der für das Tracking des Glücks entwickelt wurde, ist [hier](https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs/0x8e5f2de1fea16db5a65d4e64bca1f8a709585853749b3572ff15487db2146771?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet.vara.network) verfügbar.\n\n## Tests im Vara-Netzwerk und die Transaktion\n\nDer Code wurde mit einem einfachen Szenario getestet, bei dem das Hikikomori-Gerät Nachrichten an das Vara-Netzwerk sendet, um seinen Glückslevel zu erhöhen. Ein Beispiel dieses Szenarios und der zugehörige Code sind [hier](https://github.com/airalab/hikikomori-tamagotchi/tree/main/main) zu finden.

Uno de los dispositivos destacados es el Hikikomori Tamagotchi, ¡un excelente proyecto educativo! Al estudiar cómo funciona Hikikomori, los usuarios pueden aprender a enviar transacciones directamente desde dispositivos que cuestan menos de $10 a una nube Web3. Con ejemplos de interacción con Robonomics o Vara / Gear.exe, los usuarios también pueden ganar experiencia en la gestión del gemelo digital de un dispositivo.\n\nA partir del próximo año, **Gear Protocol** integrará el ejemplo de Tamagotchi en **[Gear.exe](https://gear-tech.io/gear-exe) - una solución sin puentes diseñada para potenciar las dApps de Ethereum** - y el dispositivo Hikikomori se utilizará en sus **clases de talleres universitarios** en todo el mundo.\n\n## Resumen de Hikikomori\n\nEl proyecto Hikikomori combina software y hardware para actuar como una mascota digital integrada con tu sistema de hogar inteligente, similar a un Tamagotchi pero con un giro único. En lugar de un juego tradicional, está vinculado a tu configuración de hogar inteligente a través de Home Assistant, donde cada interacción con tu hogar o una acción automatizada aumenta el nivel de \"felicidad\" de Hikikomori. Esta mascota digital también se conecta con las redes Robonomics y Vara, dándole una \"alma\" única dentro del ecosistema web. Periódicamente, Hikikomori actualiza su estado digital en Robonomics, con código de ejemplo disponible [aquí](https://github.com/airalab/hikikomori-tamagotchi/tree/only-robonomics/main).\n\n## Integración con la Red Vara\n\n**Utilizando [Vara Network](https://vara.network)** - una blockchain de Capa 1 con procesamiento de datos en paralelo para una escalabilidad profunda - **Hikikomori se convierte en un Tamagotchi especializado**, que **utilizará lógica** para calcular su nivel de felicidad mediante cálculos dentro de un contrato inteligente. El contrato inteligente de Tamagotchi en Vara, diseñado para rastrear la felicidad, se puede encontrar [aquí](https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs/0x8e5f2de1fea16db5a65d4e64bca1f8a709585853749b3572ff15487db2146771?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet.vara.network).\n\n## Pruebas en VARA y la Transacción\n\nEl código se ha probado utilizando un escenario básico donde el dispositivo Hikikomori envía mensajes a la red Vara para aumentar su nivel de felicidad. Un ejemplo de este escenario y el código relacionado se puede ver [aquí](https://github.com/airalab/hikikomori-tamagotchi/tree/main/main).

2025](https://x.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1856724439439913110)**」をバンコクで披露しました。紹介されたデバイスの一つが、Hikikomori Tamagotchiです—優れた教育プロジェクトです！Hikikomoriがどのように機能するかを学ぶことで、ユーザーは10ドル未満のデバイスからWeb3クラウドに直接トランザクションを送る方法を学ぶことができます。RobonomicsまたはVara / Gear.exeとのインタラクションの例を使用することで、ユーザーはデバイスのデジタルツインを管理する経験も得ることができます。\n\n来年から、**Gear Protocol**は**[Gear.exe](https://gear-tech.io/gear-exe) – EthereumのdAppを強化するために設計されたブリッジレスなソリューション**にTamagotchiの例を統合し、Hikikomoriデバイスは世界中の**大学のワークショップクラス**で使用されます！\n\n## Hikikomoriの概要\n\nHikikomoriプロジェクトは、ソフトウェアとハードウェアを組み合わせて、スマートホームシステムに統合されたデジタルペットとして機能します。これはTamagotchiに似ていますが、一味違います。従来のゲームプレイの代わりに、Home Assistantを通じてスマートホームのセットアップに接続され、家庭や自動化されたアクションとの各インタラクションがHikikomoriの「幸せ」レベルを増加させます。このデジタルペットは、RobonomicsおよびVaraネットワークにも接続され、Webエコシステム内で独自の「魂」を持つことになります。Hikikomoriは定期的にRobonomicsでデジタル状態を更新し、サンプルコードは[こちら](https://github.com/airalab/hikikomori-tamagotchi/tree/only-robonomics/main)で確認できます。\n\n## Varaネットワークとの統合\n\n**[Vara Network](https://vara.network)**を活用することにより、**Hikikomoriは特殊なTamagotchi**となり、**その幸せレベルを計算するロジック**をスマートコントラクト内での計算を通じて利用します。Vara上のTamagotchiスマートコントラクトは、幸せの追跡のために設計されており、[こちら](https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs/0x8e5f2de1fea16db5a65d4e64bca1f8a709585853749b3572ff15487db2146771?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet.vara.network)で確認できます。\n\n## VARAでのテストとトランザクション\n\nこのコードは、HikikomoriデバイスがVaraネットワークにメッセージを送信して幸せレベルを増加させる基本的なシナリオを使用してテストされました。このシナリオの例と関連コードは[こちら](https://github.com/airalab/hikikomori-tamagotchi/tree/main/main)で確認できます。また、Polkadot.jsポータルでテストのトランザクション出力も確認できます：\n\n**VARAブロック№11891410のトランザクションハッシュ:**\n`0xb07dc6d65cb2ab972e8bd372285a51897f0d54d6b05609367f54dcea166de56d`\n\nこの革新的なプロジェクトは、あなたのデジタルペットと、オートメーション、IoT、ブロックチェーンを融合させた方法で関わることを可能にし、スマートホームに楽しく意味のある追加を提供します。\n\n**Gearの詳細は[gear-tech.io](https://gear-tech.io)、Varaの詳細は[vara.network](https://vara.network)をご覧ください**","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/webp","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.a444a2aef4792e554327cbdb3888f5b7.webp","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width:

Hikikomori는 주기적으로 Robonomics에서 디지털 상태를 업데이트하며, 예제 코드는 [여기](https://github.com/airalab/hikikomori-tamagotchi/tree/only-robonomics/main)에서 확인할 수 있습니다.\n\n## Vara 네트워크와의 통합\n\n**[Vara Network](https://vara.network)**를 활용함으로써 - 깊은 확장성을 위한 병렬 데이터 처리 기능을 갖춘 Layer 1 Blockchain - **Hikikomori는 전문화된 Tamagotchi**가 되어, **행복 수준을 계산하는 로직**을 스마트 계약 내에서 계산하여 활용합니다. 행복 추적을 위해 설계된 Vara의 Tamagotchi 스마트 계약은 [여기](https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs/0x8e5f2de1fea16db5a65d4e64bca1f8a709585853749b3572ff15487db2146771?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet.vara.network)에서 확인할 수 있습니다.\n\n## VARA에서의 테스트와 트랜잭션\n\n이 코드는 Hikikomori 장치가 Vara 네트워크로 메시지를 보내 행복 수준을 증가시키는 기본 시나리오를 사용하여 테스트되었습니다. 이 시나리오의 예제 및 관련 코드는 [여기](https://github.com/airalab/hikikomori-tamagotchi/tree/main/main)에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 또한 Polkadot.js Portal에서 테스트 트랜잭션 출력을 확인할 수 있습니다:\n\n**VARA 블록 № 11891410의 트랜잭션 해시:**\n`0xb07dc6d65cb2ab972e8bd372285a51897f0d54d6b05609367f54dcea166de56d`\n\n이 혁신적인 프로젝트는 자동화, IoT, 블록체인을 결합하여 디지털 애완동물과 상호작용할 수 있는 방법을 제공하며, 스마트 홈에 재미있고 의미 있는 요소를 추가합니다.\n\n**Gear에 대해 더 알아보려면 [gear-tech.io](https://gear-tech.io)를 방문하고, Vara에 대해서는 [vara.network](https://vara.network)를 확인하십시오.**","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/webp","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.a444a2aef4792e554327cbdb3888f5b7.webp","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.a444a2aef4792e554327cbdb3888f5b7.webp 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.a444a2aef4792e554327cbdb3888f5b7.webp 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.a444a2aef4792e554327cbdb3888f5b7.webp 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-8a20f99d5d27f8975f5c64ab3052e0f2'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-8a20f99d5d27f8975f5c64ab3052e0f2)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/webp%3bbase64%2cUklGRkYDAABXRUJQVlA4IDoDAABwDwCdASpAAB0APm0okUWkIiGZ%2bzVUQAbEtgBOmUI5vkT13qcsS%2bW2Mttpeee9FO8Y7y1/hKBNzL%2bu499J%2b//MN4N6XrMR80LPl9W8Az0AGlrq0m7I4oijZi62dOkiB1%2bpmVCE5u1WEKAhcnEgtvNCT6fmO91%2bSdIC9v2Aa2tymIRyrKAA/v5Vpn23t2Lphum2L%2bW8HnnI63CVJgzjRMW4sCsCnAo6uniUiWU7aWoepdjbmjMAcuOKCQu5Ef/oP5ZG6waNgPQypr9tHunof/cNZ7veXfclg31r1TyUulxhjf4wawaVzWhi/HAW2%2bFsS3gcoOhHLWLsJKxpunOc1bLugWGBGBg%2bFQVFsjAky2mynv5rdrXt/rkr%2bBSPfyIFud95EIgbW7df3IbNZjG51HEZHBz7a/eQCO0U7VgYZ2F9qgVE0hPe/xfDuKyArXHh9JzbXpbbsViEoDScXqpRjkxJoUnBhm5HXSsP6h079AqGOzRKGEfKx5sYBfzndWYCfnB8yWCsvNhPdDf5ouq2D1e9FUSpC41mdqji8dU%2bdy/HGxCLnL%2bK6lFK2/09lOzDxrHtcLzXLxJi/aNNy8taxtLWTCM5OuWm2kKyHX/kni3ZqwZT53N4I65pKTlC5tfnt/9xfFuSqVWtXUCxVfFMOpV1asOibfgSm2lwpkCo83hZyF1BXUy5k4qLPbdRJs/4xty/aUKzTqLLiHFRwZlOCTkeSMurOZAnLUbqBVIxQMPq02S7BBnz20GVYSqj16LNh0Fd/IR356D09whYzQrPoKuvp/rzp3gr14zBOdPFZyeLMkB0H5T47rrPwEuESyVj2CdSckzyXjFjZbHnM9HyOcHGvp9ogmMsbb1hUZKNx8dzAx37gn2X%2brWP2vNEuLDVBrJ7fzD3UVfZIKx1bf4X65CrjWeEeW3OttWAReu6/f44PofuR3qk4%2bBlyuPvHCQI9Lk6LeD6nbn1YyylgrRkk6M29tJr/avASyFDM1BKiDN0z7rqfeZRtMNHcs2qKv%2b9l16x%2bR/%2b/6fMgd/4W1YPqDTHaGk/R2idp9Ld75PI/LyPfYpHpHP%2bJlHxXLvPM5Ji1Cn4sJeeRDSoAAAA' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"ko"}},{"node":{"title":"Gear Protocol integreert met Robonomics IoT-apparaten om het gebruik en onderwijs van Blockchain-technologie te versnellen","path":"/blog/nl/gear-protocol-integrates-with-robonomics-iot/","date":"November 25, 2024","description":"Vanaf volgend jaar zal Gear Protocol het Tamagotchi-voorbeeld integreren in Gear.exe - een bruggeloze oplossing ontworpen om Ethereum dApps te versnellen - en zal het Hikikomori-apparaat wereldwijd worden gebruikt in hun universitaire workshopklassen!","content":"\nHet Robonomics-team presenteerde hun eerste serie apparaten, **[\"Hardware for Cyberpunks 2025,\" in Bangkok](https://x.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1856724439439913110)**. Een van de uitgelichte apparaten is de Hikikomori Tamagotchi – een uitstekend educatief project! Door te bestuderen hoe Hikikomori werkt, kunnen gebruikers leren om transacties direct vanaf apparaten die minder dan $10 kosten naar een Web3-cloud te sturen. Door gebruik te maken van interactievoorbeelden met Robonomics of Vara / Gear.exe, kunnen gebruikers ook ervaring opdoen in het beheren van de digitale tweeling van een apparaat.\n\nVanaf volgend jaar zal **Gear Protocol** het Tamagotchi-voorbeeld integreren in **[Gear.exe](https://gear-tech.io/gear-exe) - een bruggeloze oplossing ontworpen om Ethereum dApps te versnellen** - en zal het Hikikomori-apparaat wereldwijd worden gebruikt in hun **universitaire workshopklassen**!\n\n## Hikikomori Overzicht\n\nHet Hikikomori-project combineert software en hardware om te fungeren als een digitaal huisdier dat is geïntegreerd in uw smart home-systeem, vergelijkbaar met een Tamagotchi, maar met een twist. In plaats van traditioneel gameplay, is het gekoppeld aan uw smart home-setup via Home Assistant, waar elke interactie met uw huis of een geautomatiseerde actie het \"geluksniveau\" van Hikikomori verhoogt. Dit digitale huisdier is ook verbonden met de Robonomics- en Vara-netwerken, waardoor het een unieke \"ziel\" binnen het Web Ecosysteem krijgt. Periodiek werkt Hikikomori zijn digitale status bij in Robonomics, met voorbeeldcode beschikbaar [hier](https://github.com/airalab/hikikomori-tamagotchi/tree/only-robonomics/main).\n\n## Integratie met Vara Network\n\n**Door gebruik te maken van [Vara Network](https://vara.network)** - een Layer 1 Blockchain met parallelle gegevensverwerking voor diepe schaalbaarheid - **wordt Hikikomori een gespecialiseerd Tamagotchi**, dat **logica gebruikt** om zijn geluksniveau te berekenen via berekeningen binnen een smart contract.

Um dos dispositivos em destaque é o Hikikomori Tamagotchi – um excelente projeto educacional! Ao estudar como o Hikikomori funciona, os usuários podem aprender a enviar transações diretamente de dispositivos que custam menos de $10 para uma nuvem Web3. Usando exemplos de interação com o Robonomics ou Vara / Gear.exe, os usuários também podem ganhar experiência em gerenciar o gêmeo digital de um dispositivo.\n\nA partir do próximo ano, o **Gear Protocol** integrará o exemplo do Tamagotchi no **[Gear.exe](https://gear-tech.io/gear-exe) - uma solução sem pontes projetada para potencializar dApps Ethereum** - e o dispositivo Hikikomori será usado nas suas **aulas de workshop universitárias** em todo o mundo!\n\n## Visão Geral do Hikikomori\n\nO projeto Hikikomori combina software e hardware para atuar como um pet digital integrado ao seu sistema de casa inteligente, assemelhando-se a um Tamagotchi, mas com um toque especial. Em vez de um jogo tradicional, ele está vinculado à sua configuração de casa inteligente por meio do Home Assistant, onde cada interação com sua casa ou ação automatizada aumenta o nível de \"felicidade\" do Hikikomori. Este pet digital também se conecta com as redes Robonomics e Vara, dando-lhe uma \"alma\" única dentro do Ecossistema Web. Periodicamente, o Hikikomori atualiza seu estado digital no Robonomics, com o código de exemplo disponível [aqui](https://github.com/airalab/hikikomori-tamagotchi/tree/only-robonomics/main).\n\n## Integração com a Rede Vara\n\n**Ao utilizar a [Vara Network](https://vara.network)** - uma Blockchain de Layer 1 com processamento de dados paralelo para escalabilidade profunda - **Hikikomori se torna um Tamagotchi especializado**, que **utiliza lógica** para calcular seu nível de felicidade por meio de cálculos dentro de um contrato inteligente. O contrato inteligente do Tamagotchi na Vara, projetado para rastreamento de felicidade, pode ser encontrado [aqui](https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs/0x8e5f2de1fea16db5a65d4e64bca1f8a709585853749b3572ff15487db2146771?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet.vara.network).\n\n## Testando na VARA e a Transação\n\nO código foi testado usando um cenário básico onde o dispositivo Hikikomori envia mensagens para a rede Vara para aumentar seu nível de felicidade.

evolving smart equipment market presents significant challenges. This article proposes a solution that combines digital twins for real-time monitoring, prediction markets for efficient capital allocation, and risk-sharing contracts, all governed by a transparent DAO model to enable optimal decision-making in this transformative industry.","content":"\nRecent advancements in machine learning (ML) have opened up a massive influx of opportunities for robotics to automate new tasks in the real world. While industrial robotics remains the dominant segment by size, service robots - those that operate among people - have seen the most rapid growth. The estimated dollar value of the professional service robotics market was approximately **USD 21.6 billion in 2023,** with a 38% compound annual growth rate. Breakthroughs in ML and the growing labor shortage have created a unique moment where service robotics is finally poised for widespread implementation, addressing critical needs across industries and in our daily lives.\n\n“Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) need easy access to automation” and “Democratizing” robotics are the key trends in robotics now, [according to IFR](https://ifr.org/img/worldrobotics/Press_Conference_2024.pdf). Logistics and warehousing robots have been leading this trend. First deployments of city delivery rovers have started and it is clear that route optimization is critical to keep the margins. Medical robotics have seen a huge upsurge during the pandemic and have also been one of the leading categories since, with disinfection and sterilization being the dominant use cases. Hospitality rovers in hotels and restaurants have seen a big spike in Asian markets already and we start seeing them more in Europe and the US. Agriculture, professional cleaning, inspections and maintenance, construction and heavy industries, security / search and rescue -  the list of new application areas keeps growing. Some of the most optimistic predictions say that we may have more humanoid robots than people in the next decade.\n\nHere is the list of Top-5 application areas for professional service robotics in 2023, according to the International Federation of Robotics:\n\n![card-1.png](./images/ohf-part-1/card-1.png)\n\nHowever, as these technologies evolve, traditional financing approaches fail to keep up with the unique challenges posed by smart equipment leasing and investment in robotics. \n\n**Traditional models**, like loans or leasing, are often **inadequate for smart equipment** due to rapid technological obsolescence, information asymmetry, and performance uncertainty. Robotics and AI technologies evolve quickly, making long-term investments risky, as traditional models do not account for the frequent upgrades or retrofits required. Manufacturers often have more knowledge about equipment performance than lessees, leading to inefficiencies in capital allocation or mispricing. Additionally, fixed payment schedules fail to reflect real equipment value, especially when performance depends on software updates or integration. The lack of expertise among financial institutions in managing AI-driven assets further contributes to underinvestment in these high-potential technologies.\n\nA better capital allocation system is required for smart, connected equipment. One that will be responsive to the much faster pace of innovation and resilient to uncertainties and asymmetric information held by different market participants.\n\n\n\n## Principles of Robust Mechanism Design\n\nMechanism design is a **field in economics and game theory** that focuses on designing rules or systems (mechanisms) to achieve specific objectives, even when participants have private information and may act strategically or collude. A classic example is designing auctions where bidders have private valuations of the goods being auctioned.\n\nA key challenge in robust mechanism design is handling **type spaces**—all possible characteristics of agents, like their preferences and beliefs. Since we can't account for all possible type spaces, mechanisms must be designed to handle diverse situations where agents may not fully know each other's preferences or beliefs.\n\nThere are many **different agents** that can be directly involved in equipment deal, like **equipment manufacturers (OEMs)**, **integrators and maintenance providers**, **asset originators**, **underwriters**, and **investors.** Coordination among them involves significant transactional costs, not to mention the additional complexities of addressing broader public interests. Despite the complexity of these interactions, we have a goal to develop a robust mechanism that:\n\n- **Ensures incentive compatibility** for all market participants\n- **Allocates capital to achieve ex-post efficiency**\n- **Remains resilient to uncertainties** in market conditions and the beliefs of participants.\n\nLet me illustrate this with a simple example to make it easier to understand:\n\n**Incentive Compatibility**: Imagine you're playing a game where you need to tell how much you like different candies. If you tell the truth, you'll get your favorite candy. Incentive compatibility means that your best option is to be honest because that way, you'll get what you really want. In other words, being truthful is the smartest move.\n\n**Ex-Post Efficiency**: After everyone have shared their favorites, the candies are handed out. Ex-post efficiency means that everyone ends up with the candy they like best, and no candy goes to waste or is given to someone who doesn't like it. It ensures that everyone gets their favorite treat, making everyone as happy as possible with what they receive.\n\nI believe it is important to use incentive compatible mechanisms when introducing such an important new technologies, like Robotics and Embodied AI, that have the potential to fundamentally alter the fabric of society. Ensuring that these mechanisms are robust is essential for maximizing social benefit and achieving fair, efficient outcomes in the deployment of transformative technologies.\n\n\n\n## Real-World Asset (RWA) Market Design for Smart Equipment\n\nDesigning a robust mechanism for capital allocation into new categories of smart equipment is incredibly challenging due to the complexity and evolving nature of the field. However, I see an opportunity for several strategies to enhance robustness of this mechanism.\n\n\n### **Digital Twins and Beyond** \n\nThis is at the core of what Robonomics does. In the article [\"Introduction to Digital Twins\"](https://robonomics.network/blog/digital-twins-introduction/), we explained the concept - digital representations of physical entities or processes. Digital Twins are not static models but dynamic systems that continuously receive real-time data from their physical counterparts, allowing for ongoing updates and accurate reflections of the current state. This continuous data flow enables precise simulations and analyses, facilitating informed decisions regarding the operation, maintenance, and optimization of physical assets.\n\nTo effectively capture and manage data from smart equipment, Robonomics offers an open-source tool called [Otaberu](https://robonomics.network/blog/otaberu-part-1/). Otaberu is designed to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) networking for edge devices and robotics, enabling seamless and secure communication between devices without extensive network configuration. It provides a robust framework for data collection and management of digital twins.\n\nDigital twins serve as the foundational layer for implementing robust mechanism designs for capital allocation in smart equipment markets. By providing a comprehensive and real-time digital representation of physical assets, digital twins enable precise monitoring and analysis of equipment performance, usage patterns, and maintenance needs. This detailed insight allows for the development of sophisticated strategies that optimize capital allocation, ensuring resources are directed efficiently to maximize returns and enhance the longevity and productivity of smart equipment.\n\nDigital Twins in the context of capital allocation also open the conversation about autonomous robocorporations, which are guided by on-chain governance mechanisms. These autonomous entities can independently execute decisions based on market input, making them capable of managing assets, allocating resources, and even engaging in economic transactions without human intervention.\n\n\n### **Prediction Markets**\n\nPrediction markets and robust mechanism design both aim to elicit truthful information from agents with private knowledge to achieve efficient outcomes. By integrating prediction markets into our mechanism framework, we can **improve ex-post efficiency** of capital allocation decisions by ensuring that decisions reflect the most up-to-date and accurate information available, leading to better alignment of resource allocation with realized outcomes.\n\nThe following steps illustrate how the process could be implemented:\n\n- Establish a prediction market for each category of smart equipment under consideration (delivery rovers, packaging arms, etc.).\n- Allow a broad group of stakeholders to trade contracts based on future performance metrics of the equipment, such as uptime percentage and maintenance costs.\n- Use the market price to reflect the collective belief about whether the equipment will meet specific performance benchmarks over the lease period.\n- If the prediction market indicates a high probability that the equipment will perform well (e.g., high uptime and low maintenance costs), allocate more capital towards leasing that equipment.\n- Conversely, if the prediction market suggests poor performance, reduce capital allocation or adjust lease terms to mitigate potential losses.\n- Prediction market participants are rewarded or slashed depending on the bets they make.\n\nPrediction markets allow for efficient aggregation of private knowledge from diverse stakeholders, real-time updates on performance expectations, and continuous adaptation to new information, which reduce uncertainty and result in a more resilient mechanism design.\n\nWhen new information becomes available, such as updated Digital Twin of the smart equipment, prediction market prices adjust accordingly, allowing for dynamic reallocation of capital. This helps mitigate the risk of over-investing in underperforming assets while ensuring that high-performing assets receive appropriate funding in the long run.\n\nBy aligning capital allocation with continuously updated market insights, underwriters can make better-informed decisions, optimize their portfolios and reduce financial risk.\n\n\n### **Risk Sharing Strategies**\n\nRisk-sharing strategies play a crucial role in reshaping capital allocation mechanism for smart equipment, helping to balance risks and **increase incentive compatibility**. Traditional leasing arrangements are relatively rigid, typically relying on fixed payments without accounting for the equipment's dynamic performance or unexpected changes. \n\nStrategies like insurance-style contracts or performance-based bonuses can be employed to create a more flexible and adaptive approach that effectively shares risks and lead to a more robust mechanism design.\n\nFor instance, an insurance-style contract can help distribute the risk of unforeseen downtimes: if Digital Twin data reveals unexpected downtime due to manufacturer defects, part of the payment might be refunded. This way, the financial burden of operational issues is mitigated, and everyone is incentivized to maintain performance.\n\nThe pay-for-outcomes model provides an additional layer of risk sharing. Robots-as-a-service (RAAS) model is gaining momentum in robotics, but is still considered novel by many traditional equipment financing players. By tying payments to the business benefits generated by the technology (like the number of boxes moved in a day or miles driven in autonomous delivery) participants are encouraged to focus on achieving tangible outcomes.\n\nFor example, if a logistics robot enhances warehouse efficiency by 20%, a portion of that efficiency gain can be used to fund the monthly payment. This approach helps businesses connect the cost of equipment to their own operational success, reducing financial risk during uncertain periods when outcomes might be less predictable. The alignment here is twofold: businesses feel more secure that they are only paying in proportion to the value they receive, while suppliers are encouraged to provide equipment that reliably delivers business benefits.\n\nWith smart equipment that can generate data in real-time, robust risk-sharing mechanisms become feasible, allowing for dynamic responses to performance issues and aligning incentives around actual outcomes. This evolution in leasing structures allows market participants to respond adaptively to technological change, ensuring that the risks and rewards of adopting advanced equipment are shared more equitably. In effect, the relationship becomes more of a partnership, rather than a rigid contractual arrangement, fostering trust and encouraging innovation.\n\n\n### **DAO Governance for Equipment Origination and Underwriting**\n\nIt is crucial to establish governance structures that support efficient, incentive-aligned capital allocation over the next 3-5 years as the robotics industry takes shape. \n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an ideal governance structure for managing the underwriting process in smart equipment deals. It’s main goal is to determine which new categories to support and how to allocate capital effectively. \n\nBy applying principles from robust mechanism design we can improve the odds that resources are directed towards high-value investment opportunities while minimizing risks associated with asymmetric information and market uncertainties.\n\nThe Underwriters DAO should use auction-based mechanisms to make informed bets on promising categories. Prediction market insights should enhance the accuracy of valuations and inform bidding strategies here. An autonomous process can then allocate capital optimally, based on the unique combination of beliefs held by the members of the Underwriters DAO.\n\nAs the initial capital is pooled in the DAO and allocated, a feedback loop based on Digital Twin data starts to drive further decision-making. At this stage, a larger pool of investors can start participating via additional tranches, offering hedge, equipment-backed product to digital asset investors. \n\nThe ability to decide which deals are offered to the larger community of pooled investors is critical, and successful bets should be appropriately rewarded. This is what creates the value for being a part of the governance of the DAO on its own, separate from the asset-backed stake proportionate to capital invested into smart equipment.\n\nHere is a simple scheme of operation for such a DAO:\n\n![card-2.png](./images/ohf-part-1/card-2.png)\n\n\n\n## **Practical Considerations and Next Steps**\n\nThis is just the beginning. My goal is to create a robust capital allocation mechanism that makes the productivity gains of the robotics revolution accessible to everyone. \n\nIdeas above offer a good stating point, but there are limitations that need to be considered. Participants may still engage in strategic behavior if they believe they can influence prices for personal gain and limited liquidity at the early stages can make it even easier. With enough liquidity in prediction and capital markets this can be overcome, but at the early stages it is important to carefully pick the members of the Underwriters DAO.\n\n**Steps to launch robust mechanism for capital allocation in new categories of smart equipment:**\n\n1. Launch prediction markets to choose new categories\n2. Form Underwriters DAO to start making first deals\n3. Use risk-sharing contracts to manage portfolio risk\n4. Use Digital Twin Data to improve allocation further\n5. Develop a structure for broader investor participation in the robotics revolution productivity gains\n\nIf you're interested in being a part of this journey or just want to ask a few questions - leave you email below.\n\n*Vitaly, Evangelist of Robonomics*\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/webp","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.992a7950a769a4092057bf982b5f4f20.webp","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.992a7950a769a4092057bf982b5f4f20.webp 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.992a7950a769a4092057bf982b5f4f20.webp 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.992a7950a769a4092057bf982b5f4f20.webp 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-e56731b077387b54989f5aa947eda0fb'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-e56731b077387b54989f5aa947eda0fb)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/webp%3bbase64%2cUklGRk4CAABXRUJQVlA4IEICAABwCgCdASpAAB0APm0qkkYkIiGhMBQN%2bIANiWUAtkQU0DoiYFnaDYtdTJVO27vdE8quth/XYQm5tTofqmx3yYmKkcCq9lYjnWmLl2VF0vsZ5j4q6q/qGA7n5dLfwAD%2b7fEWfIqi3v2/vyva8%2bFziy4F7FooyIuxwEuz/BecxZ7cwzv8IhD%2bvn2pzlwQbaNsRMGD%2bF7a9TFRguZ0abmxVqicK7AFZuwL31XALTPMAWSueJJQN6op7UC1YAl0UL1RWScVsdCF/0qoF841rhmAGiPHy3loaBj75OUZgQpmY0AKpzSVKGSAlQ%2bu537MA%2bpQST8keKlR9uLzlR8gL7pm8upmFZEpUxvzDEKhjCVpcO4yhSzAK85fcRc/vf%2bUEHTDsbb/VkTdzOaxe33bNNW/oQhYGaoygg1sUcJMh2A6Ewz0dybumiKEvrSwBYIlGt3nbFaYJqMlFHTywZlSzojuHJrGf1MX7u4JUL/X/OGEJNfZ/i%2b9MBUXd06Nl1uF8qeg5wvAyAt%2bkVHPd0g5IaN250OlPlmpBqb8ZmAmRbEXhorD/TGAyevlNk0E%2bG2O4DkRgrdjLb8mluZ0%2bCLmO5fhIrWNp7rUJwm2SrFCX5d95isINmgr%2b0XmlgK7j%2beUq7SyEOQr3kMVZ%2bLb%2bIpwPLmVwojouajtMvkwD0K7u7OJZtMGPXT3kCaxlPPedDQb%2bLqb6A%2bYLBFWxDI8drqxYucvhi1roUgFh3b6NTdst5ViT8RU7CXgXpNZ157EeviBf17a34AAAA==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Otaberu - Open-Source Tool to Manage P2P Networks for Edge Devices and Robotics","path":"/blog/otaberu-part-1/","date":"October 19, 2024","description":"The rapid growth in device numbers creates new challenges for availability and security. A more efficient solution is needed for secure device communication that addresses SSH-based PKI limitations. Robot-agent Otaberu offers this solution, enabling a custom PKI for robots using modern libP2P standards and protocols to resolve these issues.","content":"\nAt the dawn of the computer era, multiple people used a single computer. Now, the number of devices around us is proliferating, and it's common for each person to have two, three, or more devices. Companies own hundreds or thousands of devices that form fleets, and soon, most people will have fleets of devices the size of small businesses today. As a result, there is a growing need for simple yet effective tools to secure communication between these devices, surpassing the limitations of traditional methods like SSH.\n\nWe are introducing [otaberu](https://github.com/airalab/otaberu) - an open-source tool designed to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) networking for edge devices and robotics. This tool focuses on accessibility, enabling seamless connection of robots and edge devices locally or globally without the need for extensive network configuration. Released under the MIT license, this tool provides the security and transparency developers of important physical infrastructure projects really need. Whether you are managing a small robotics lab or a fleet of millions, this P2P solution is designed to adapt to your requirements. It enables global communication using built-in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), allowing effortless switching between local and global operations without manual reconfiguration. The core protocol used in this tool has been tested in some of the largest distributed systems, ensuring robustness and reliability. The tool is well-suited for a range of use cases, including CI/CD automation, software deployments, and efficient configuration updates for large-scale robot fleets. This post will delve into the technical specifics and explore potential applications.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZKs4cWMLTE\n\n*This short video demonstration shows possibilities of otaberu in case of Boston Dynamics Spot*\n\n## Key features\n\n### Access management\n\nThere are three common methods of access control for computers. The first - using passwords - is characteristic of unskilled users. It is the weakest in terms of security. The second - authorization by cryptographic key - is typically used by IT specialists in most organizations. It already requires some system administration skills from users for issuing, storing, and ensuring the security of these keys because they are usually stored on the hard drive. And finally, the most secure method is authorization through certificates. Usually, maintaining such a system requires additional services that need configuration. It is the most complex method, requires high qualifications, and is mainly used by large IT companies like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, for whom maintaining IT infrastructure is directly related to the value they bring to their customers.\n\nOtaberu aims to provide ordinary developers with the highest level of protection without deploying complex secret management services and deep networking knowledge. The tool enables the creation of a CA (Certificate Authority) analog based on the cryptographic keys of the robot fleet owner. The role of CA in otaberu is played by the owner - the first and key role in the set of otaberu functions. The owner possesses a single configuration file for their robot fleet, through which access management is carried out. There, the owner lists all their robots, their keys and metadata, and users authorized to connect to them. Our team has also developed a command-line utility called rn-cli to create and edit the configuration file using a terminal interface. The ability to launch a terminal interface is especially significant for devices without a graphical display, like remote or single-board computers with limited resources.\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/otaberu-part-1/otaberu-tui-1.png\" alt=\"Otaberu TUI Users Interface\" />  \n\n*Terminal User Interface - Users*\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/otaberu-part-1/otaberu-tui-2.png\" alt=\"Otaberu TUI Robots Interface\" />  \n\n*Terminal User Interface - Robots*\n\n### Network **Accessibility**\n\nIn the article [Secure Robotics Remote Control: Robonomics Solution](https://robonomics.network/blog/secure-robotics-remote-control-via-web3/), we first touched upon the aspect of secure connection to robots, the problems that arise in the form of NAT, and what the Web3 world can offer in this regard, where we briefly mentioned the libP2P library.\n\nIn general, libP2P is not exactly a library, as it is usually called. Its nature is twofold. On one hand, libP2P represents a so-called network stack or set of specifications. In this regard, it is more similar to the Internet rather than any specific software project.\n\nThe legendary classic of the open source movement, creator of ZeroMQ Peter Hintjens, wrote in his book \"Social Architecture\": \n\n> The innovative nature of the Internet comes not from a small, select band of Einsteins. It comes from RFCs anyone can use and improve, made by hundreds and thousands of smart, though not uniquely smart, individuals. It comes from open-source software that anyone can use and improve. It comes from sharing, remixing, and scale of community. It comes from the continuous accretion of good solutions, and the disposal of bad ones.\n\nAt the core of libP2P are various documents or specifications that standardize formats, protocols, and conventions, prescribing how various P2P technologies should work. The second aspect of libP2P, or the periphery of this stack, consists of libraries implementing these standards. These libraries are written in different programming languages (currently, implementations in Go, Rust, TypeScript, Nim, C++, Swift, Kotlin/JVM, Python exist and are actively developing) or frameworks. Still, they are all compatible with each other if they support the same set of standards and the protocol used.\n\nThe carefully designed original architecture of libP2P allows the use of different transport options (tcp, quic, websocket), routing and NAT traversal (autonat, circuit-relay-v2, hole-punching), secure connection (tls, noise), node discovery (bootstrap, random-walk, mdns-discovery, rendezvous), message transmission protocols, data stream multiplexing, and other tools for creating peer-to-peer networks. Detailed information can be obtained on the [libp2p.io implementations page](https://libP2P.io/implementations/).\n\nWith the help of libP2P, otaberu simplifies device connectivity without complex network configurations. Devices without direct internet access can connect to other devices in the local area network and receive updates from the global network. By combining these technologies, this tool allows for the efficient self-organization of robots and edge devices into cohesive networks, regardless of whether they operate in the same physical space or are distributed globally.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nThe capabilities of this tool are extensive, offering solutions to a variety of networking challenges in edge devices and robotics:\n\n- **CI/CD Pipelines for Robotics Development**: Enable automation of CI/CD processes across the robotics fleet. This tool supports updating software across multiple nodes efficiently, streamlining development and deployment cycles.\n- **Data Stream Pipelines**: Establish reliable communication for data collection and processing within a fleet. This leads to consistent insights from the data generated by different edge devices, helping to un-silo the data.\n- **Configuration Updates Without Internet Access**: One practical example is a robot receiving an updated configuration from a cloud service and then sharing this update locally with other robots in the network. This approach allows non-internet-connected robots to stay up-to-date without requiring direct internet connectivity.\n\n### Future Enhancements\n\nWe are actively working on expanding the functionality of this P2P tool:\n\n- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Introducing user-based access controls to enable different levels of permissions. This will allow system administrators, developers, and end-users to interact with specific robots or functionalities according to their role.\n- **Optimized Data Streaming**: Implementing direct links after initial discovery through libP2P to enhance video streaming performance, optimizing the available bandwidth for video-heavy use cases.\n\n### Stay Informed\n\nThis post is part of our ongoing series covering modern robotics software development. Future articles will include discussions on PKI integration in robotics, effective CI/CD strategies, and best practices for integrating this tool with ROS 2 (Robot Operating System). For developers interested in building distributed systems, managing robotics networks, or expanding fleet capabilities, this tool is designed to provide value and simplify your operations. We encourage you to explore the open-source repository and contribute to its development. We'd love to get your feedback on Github or Discord.\n\n**Get Started**: Access our open-source repository [here](https://github.com/airalab/otaberu) and follow the documentation to set up your first P2P network. \n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/png","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.e3a864df486de004a762bb5da7e8fece.png","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width:

2024","description":"De snelle groei van het aantal apparaten creëert nieuwe uitdagingen op het gebied van beschikbaarheid en beveiliging. Een efficiëntere oplossing is nodig voor veilige communicatie tussen apparaten die de beperkingen van SSH-gebaseerde PKI aanpakken. Robot-agent Otaberu biedt deze oplossing door een aangepaste PKI voor robots mogelijk te maken met moderne libP2P-standaarden en protocollen.","content":"\nAan het begin van het computertijdperk gebruikten meerdere mensen één computer. Tegenwoordig neemt het aantal apparaten om ons heen exponentieel toe, en het is gebruikelijk dat elke persoon twee, drie of meer apparaten heeft. Bedrijven bezitten honderden of duizenden apparaten die samen vloten vormen, en binnenkort zal het voor veel mensen normaal zijn om een vloot apparaten te beheren ter grootte van een klein bedrijf. Dit leidt tot een groeiende behoefte aan eenvoudige maar effectieve tools om de communicatie tussen deze apparaten te beveiligen, voorbij de beperkingen van traditionele methoden zoals SSH.\n\nWij introduceren [otaberu](https://github.com/airalab/otaberu) - een open-source tool die peer-to-peer (P2P) netwerken voor edge devices en robotica faciliteert. Deze tool richt zich op toegankelijkheid, waardoor robots en edge devices naadloos lokaal of wereldwijd verbinding kunnen maken zonder uitgebreide netwerkconfiguratie. Uitgebracht onder de MIT-licentie, biedt deze tool de beveiliging en transparantie die ontwikkelaars van kritische fysieke infrastructuurprojecten echt nodig hebben. Of je nu een klein roboticalab beheert of een vloot van miljoenen apparaten, deze P2P-oplossing is ontworpen om zich aan te passen aan jouw behoeften. Het maakt wereldwijde communicatie mogelijk met een ingebouwde Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), waardoor eenvoudig gewisseld kan worden tussen lokale en wereldwijde operaties zonder handmatige herconfiguratie. Het kernprotocol van deze tool is getest in enkele van de grootste gedistribueerde systemen, wat robuustheid en betrouwbaarheid garandeert.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZKs4cWMLTE\n\n*Deze korte videodemonstratie toont de mogelijkheden van otaberu met de Boston Dynamics Spot-robot.*\n\nBelangrijkste kenmerken\nToegangsbeheer\nEr zijn drie veelgebruikte methoden voor toegangsbewaking bij computers. De eerste - het gebruik van wachtwoorden - is kenmerkend voor onervaren gebruikers. Het is de zwakste methode qua beveiliging. De tweede - autorisatie via een cryptografische sleutel - wordt doorgaans gebruikt door IT-specialisten in de meeste organisaties. Het vereist al enige systeembeheervaardigheden van gebruikers voor het uitgeven, opslaan en waarborgen van de beveiliging van deze sleutels, omdat ze meestal op de harde schijf worden opgeslagen. En tenslotte is de meest veilige methode autorisatie via certificaten. Het onderhouden van zo'n systeem vereist doorgaans extra diensten die geconfigureerd moeten worden. Het is de meest complexe methode, vereist hoge kwalificaties en wordt voornamelijk gebruikt door grote IT-bedrijven zoals Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, voor wie het onderhouden van IT-infrastructuur direct gerelateerd is aan de waarde die zij aan hun klanten bieden.\n\nOtaberu heeft als doel gewone ontwikkelaars het hoogste niveau van bescherming te bieden zonder complexe geheimenbeheer-diensten en diepgaande netwerkinformatie. De tool maakt het mogelijk om een CA (Certificate Authority) analogie te creëren op basis van de cryptografische sleutels van de eigenaar van de robotvloot. De rol van CA in Otaberu wordt vervuld door de eigenaar - de eerste en belangrijkste rol in de set van Otaberu-functies. De eigenaar beschikt over een enkel configuratiebestand voor zijn robotvloot, waarmee het toegangsbeheer wordt uitgevoerd. Daarin somt de eigenaar al zijn robots op, hun sleutels en metadata, en de gebruikers die bevoegd zijn om verbinding te maken. Ons team heeft ook een commandoregeltool ontwikkeld, genaamd rn-cli, om het configuratiebestand te maken en te bewerken met behulp van een terminalinterface. De mogelijkheid om een terminalinterface te starten is vooral belangrijk voor apparaten zonder grafisch display, zoals remote computers of single-board computers met beperkte middelen.\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/otaberu-part-1/otaberu-tui-1.png\" alt=\"Otaberu TUI Gebruikersinterface\" />\n\nTerminal Gebruikersinterface - Gebruikers\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/otaberu-part-1/otaberu-tui-2.png\" alt=\"Otaberu TUI Robots Interface\" />\n\nTerminal Gebruikersinterface - Robots\n\nNetwerk Toegankelijkheid\nIn het artikel Secure Robotics Remote Control: Robonomics Solution hebben we voor het eerst het aspect van een veilige verbinding met robots besproken, de problemen die zich voordoen in de vorm van NAT, en wat de Web3-wereld hierin kan bieden, waarbij we kort de libP2P-bibliotheek noemden.\n\nIn het algemeen is libP2P niet precies een bibliotheek, zoals het vaak wordt genoemd. De aard ervan is dubbel. Enerzijds vertegenwoordigt libP2P een zogenaamde netwerkstack of een set specificaties. In dit opzicht lijkt het meer op het internet dan op een specifiek softwareproject.\n\nDe legendarische klassieker van de open-sourcebeweging, maker van ZeroMQ Peter Hintjens, schreef in zijn boek \"Social Architecture\":\n\n> De innovatieve aard van het internet komt niet van een klein select groepje Einstein’s. Het komt van RFC's die iedereen kan gebruiken en verbeteren, gemaakt door honderden en duizenden slimme, maar niet uniek slimme, individuen. Het komt van open-source software die iedereen kan gebruiken en verbeteren. Het komt van delen, remixeren en de schaal van de gemeenschap. Het komt van de voortdurende aanwas van goede oplossingen en het afstoten van slechte.\n\nIn de kern van libP2P bevinden zich verschillende documenten of specificaties die formaten, protocollen en conventies standaardiseren en voorschrijven hoe verschillende P2P-technologieën zouden moeten werken. Het tweede aspect van libP2P, of de periferie van deze stack, bestaat uit bibliotheken die deze standaarden implementeren. Deze bibliotheken zijn geschreven in verschillende programmeertalen (momenteel bestaan er implementaties in Go, Rust, TypeScript, Nim, C++, Swift, Kotlin/JVM, Python en zijn ze actief in ontwikkeling) of frameworks. Toch zijn ze allemaal compatibel met elkaar als ze dezelfde set van standaarden en het gebruikte protocol ondersteunen.\n\nDe zorgvuldig ontworpen oorspronkelijke architectuur van libP2P maakt het gebruik van verschillende transportopties mogelijk (tcp, quic, websocket), routering en NAT-traversal (autonat, circuit-relay-v2, hole-punching), veilige verbinding (tls, noise), node-ontdekking (bootstrap, random-walk, mdns-discovery, rendezvous), berichttransmissieprotocollen, gegevensstroommultiplexing en andere tools voor het creëren van peer-to-peer-netwerken. Gedetailleerde informatie kan worden verkregen op de [libp2p.io implementatiepagina](https://libP2P.io/implementations/).\n\nMet behulp van libP2P vereenvoudigt Otaberu de apparaatverbinding zonder complexe netwerkconfiguraties. Apparaten zonder directe internettoegang kunnen verbinding maken met andere apparaten in het lokale netwerk en updates ontvangen van het wereldwijde netwerk. Door deze technologieën te combineren, maakt deze tool de efficiënte zelforganisatie van robots en edge-apparaten in samenhangende netwerken mogelijk, ongeacht of ze zich in dezelfde fysieke ruimte bevinden of wereldwijd verspreid zijn.\n\n## Toepassingsgebieden\n\nDe mogelijkheden van deze tool zijn uitgebreid en bieden oplossingen voor verschillende netwerkuitdagingen in edge-apparaten en robotica:\n\n- **CI/CD-pijplijnen voor Robotica-ontwikkeling**: Automatiseer de CI/CD-processen binnen de robotvloot. Deze tool ondersteunt het efficiënt bijwerken van software over meerdere knooppunten, waardoor ontwikkelings- en implementatiecycli worden gestroomlijnd.\n- **Gegevensstroompijplijnen**: Zet betrouwbare communicatie op voor gegevensverzameling en verwerking binnen een vloot. Dit leidt tot consistente inzichten uit de gegevens die door verschillende edge-apparaten worden gegenereerd, wat helpt om gegevens uit silo's te halen.\n- **Configuratie-updates zonder internettoegang**: Een praktisch voorbeeld is een robot die een bijgewerkte configuratie ontvangt van een cloudservice en deze vervolgens lokaal deelt met andere robots in het netwerk. Deze benadering maakt het mogelijk om robots zonder internetverbinding up-to-date te houden zonder directe internetverbinding.\n\n### Toekomstige Verbeteringen\n\nWe werken actief aan het uitbreiden van de functionaliteit van deze P2P-tool:\n\n- **Toegangscontrolelijsten (ACL's)**: Het introduceren van gebruikersgebaseerde toegangscontrole om verschillende niveaus van machtigingen in te stellen. Dit stelt systeembeheerders, ontwikkelaars en eindgebruikers in staat om met specifieke robots of functionaliteiten te werken op basis van hun rol.\n- **Geoptimaliseerde Gegevensstreaming**: Het implementeren van directe verbindingen na de initiële ontdekking via libP2P om de videostreamingprestaties te verbeteren en de beschikbare bandbreedte te optimaliseren voor video-intensieve toepassingen.\n\n### Blijf Geïnformeerd\n\nDit bericht maakt deel uit van onze doorlopende serie over moderne softwareontwikkeling voor robotica. Toekomstige artikelen zullen onder andere discussies bevatten over de integratie van PKI in robotica, effectieve CI/CD-strategieën en best practices voor de integratie van deze tool met ROS 2 (Robot Operating System). Voor ontwikkelaars die geïnteresseerd zijn in het bouwen van gedistribueerde systemen, het beheren van robotica-netwerken of het uitbreiden van vlootcapaciteiten, is deze tool ontworpen om waarde te bieden en uw operaties te vereenvoudigen. We moedigen u aan om de open-source repository te verkennen en bij te dragen aan de ontwikkeling ervan.

2024","description":"Быстрый рост числа устройств создает новые вызовы для доступности и безопасности. Необходимо более эффективное решение для безопасного обмена данными между устройствами, которое устраняет ограничения на основе SSH PKI. Робот-агент Otaberu предлагает это решение, обеспечивая настраиваемое PKI для роботов с использованием современных стандартов и протоколов libP2P для решения этих проблем.","content":"\nНа заре компьютерной эры несколько человек использовали один компьютер. Сейчас количество устройств вокруг нас увеличивается, и обычно у каждого человека есть два, три или более устройств. Компании владеют сотнями или тысячами устройств, которые образуют флоты, и вскоре у большинства людей будут флоты устройств размером с небольшие бизнесы сегодня. В результате возникает растущая потребность в простых, но эффективных инструментах для обеспечения безопасной связи между этими устройствами, превосходящих ограничения традиционных методов, таких как SSH..\n\nМы представляем [otaberu](https://github.com/airalab/otaberu) - инструмент с открытым исходным кодом, разработанный для облегчения пирингового (P2P) взаимодействия для краевых устройств и робототехники. Этот инструмент фокусируется на доступности, обеспечивая безпрепятственное подключение роботов и краевых устройств локально или глобально без необходимости обширной настройки сети. Выпущенный под лицензией MIT, этот инструмент обеспечивает безопасность и прозрачность, которые разработчики важных проектов физической инфраструктуры действительно нуждаются. Независимо от того, управляете ли вы небольшой лабораторией робототехники или флотом миллионов, эта P2P-решение разработана для адаптации к вашим требованиям. Она обеспечивает глобальное взаимодействие с использованием встроенной инфраструктуры открытых ключей (PKI), позволяя легко переключаться между локальными и глобальными операциями без ручной перенастройки. Основной протокол, используемый в этом инструменте, был протестирован в некоторых из крупнейших распределенных систем, обеспечивая надежность и надежность. Инструмент хорошо подходит для ряда сценариев использования, включая автоматизацию CI/CD, развертывание программного обеспечения и эффективные обновления конфигурации для крупных флотов роботов. В этом посте мы рассмотрим технические детали и исследуем потенциальные применения.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZKs4cWMLTE\n\n*Это короткое видеодемонстрация показывает возможности otaberu в случае Boston Dynamics Spot*\n\n## Основные функции\n\n### Управление доступом\n\nСуществуют три общих метода контроля доступа к компьютерам. Первый - использование паролей - характерен для неопытных пользователей. Это самый слабый метод.В терминах безопасности. Второй - авторизация с использованием криптографического ключа - обычно используется специалистами по ИТ в большинстве организаций. Это уже требует определенных навыков системного администрирования от пользователей для выдачи, хранения и обеспечения безопасности этих ключей, поскольку они обычно хранятся на жестком диске. И, наконец, самый безопасный метод - авторизация через сертификаты. Обычно поддержка такой системы требует дополнительных служб, которые требуют настройки. Это самый сложный метод, требует высокой квалификации и в основном используется крупными ИТ-компаниями, такими как Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, для которых поддержка ИТ-инфраструктуры напрямую связана со значением, которое они приносят своим клиентам.\n\nOtaberu стремится предоставить обычным разработчикам высший уровень защиты без развертывания сложных служб управления секретами и глубоких знаний в сетевых технологиях. Инструмент позволяет создать аналог ЦС (Центра сертификации) на основе криптографических ключей владельца флота роботов. Роль ЦС в otaberu играет владелец - первая и ключевая роль в наборе функций otaberu. Владелец обладает единственным файлом конфигурации для своего флота роботов, через который осуществляется управление доступом. В этом файле владелец перечисляет всех своих роботов, их ключи и метаданные, а также пользователей, которым разрешен доступ к ним. Наша команда также разработала утилиту командной строки под названием rn-cli для создания и редактирования файла конфигурации с использованием терминального интерфейса. Возможность запуска терминального интерфейса особенно важна для устройств без графического дисплея, таких как удаленные или одноплатные компьютеры с ограниченными ресурсами.\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/otaberu-part-1/otaberu-tui-1.png\" alt=\"Интерфейс пользователя Otaberu TUI\" />  \n\n*Пользовательский интерфейс терминала - Пользователи*\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/otaberu-part-1/otaberu-tui-1.png\" alt=\"Интерфейс роботов Otaberu TUI\" />  \n\n*Пользовательский интерфейс терминала - Роботы*\n\n### **Доступность сети**\n\nВ статье [Безопасное удаленное управление робототехникой: решение Robonomics](https://robonomics.network/blog/secure-robotics-remote-control-via-web3/) мы впервые коснулись аспекта безопасного подключения к роботам, проблем, возникающих в виде NAT, и того, что мир Web3 может предложить в этом отношении, где мы кратко упомянули библиотеку libP2P.\n\nВ общем, libP2P не совсем библиотека, как обычно говорят. Его природа двойственна. С одной стороны, libP2P представляет собой так называемый сетевой стек или набор спецификаций. В этом отношении он больше похож на Интернет, чем на какой-либо конкретный программный проект.\n\nЛегендарный классик движения открытого исходного кода, создатель ZeroMQ Питер Хинтженс, написал в своей книге \"Социальная архитектура\":\n\n> Инновационная природа Интернета не происходит от небольшой, избранной группы Эйнштейнов. Она происходит от RFC, которыми может воспользоваться и улучшить кто угодно, созданных сотнями и тысячамиУмных, хотя и не уникально умных, людей. Он происходит из программного обеспечения с открытым исходным кодом, которым может воспользоваться и улучшить кто угодно. Он происходит от обмена, ремиксов и масштаба сообщества. Он происходит от непрерывного наращивания хороших решений и устранения плохих.\n\nВ основе libP2P находятся различные документы или спецификации, которые стандартизируют форматы, протоколы и соглашения, предписывая, как должны работать различные технологии P2P. Второй аспект libP2P, или периферия этого стека, состоит из библиотек, реализующих эти стандарты. Эти библиотеки написаны на разных языках программирования (в настоящее время существуют реализации на Go, Rust, TypeScript, Nim, C++, Swift, Kotlin/JVM, Python и активно развиваются) или фреймворках. Тем не менее, они все совместимы между собой, если поддерживают одинаковый набор стандартов и используемый протокол.\n\nТщательно разработанная исходная архитектура libP2P позволяет использовать различные варианты транспорта (tcp, quic, websocket), маршрутизацию и обход NAT (autonat, circuit-relay-v2, hole-punching), безопасное соединение (tls, noise), обнаружение узлов (bootstrap, random-walk, mdns-discovery, rendezvous), протоколы передачи сообщений, мультиплексирование потоков данных и другие инструменты для создания пиринговых сетей. Подробную информацию можно получить на странице [реализаций libp2p.io](https://libP2P.io/implementations/)С помощью libP2P otaberu упрощает подключение устройств без сложной настройки сети. Устройства без прямого доступа в Интернет могут подключаться к другим устройствам в локальной сети и получать обновления из глобальной сети. Объединяя эти технологии, этот инструмент позволяет эффективно самоорганизовывать роботов и краевые устройства в единые сети, независимо от того, работают ли они в одном физическом пространстве или распределены по всему миру.\n\n## Сценарии использования\n\nВозможности этого инструмента обширны, предлагая решения для различных сетевых задач на краевых устройствах и в робототехнике:\n\n- **CI/CD Pipelines для разработки робототехники**: Обеспечьте автоматизацию процессов CI/CD по всему флоту роботов. Этот инструмент поддерживает обновление программного обеспечения на нескольких узлах эффективно, оптимизируя циклы разработки и развертывания.\n- **Каналы потоков данных**: Установите надежное взаимодействие для сбора и обработки данных в рамках флота. Это приводит к последовательным выводам из данных, сгенерированных различными краевыми устройствами, помогая разблокировать данные.\n- **Обновления конфигурации без доступа в Интернет**: Одним из практических примеров является робот, получающий обновленную конфигурацию из облачного сервиса и затем распространяющий это обновление локально на других роботов в сети. Такой подход позволяет роботам без доступа в Интернет оставаться в актуальном состоянии без необходимости прямого подключения к Интернету.\n\n### Планы по улучшению\n\nМы активно работаем над расширением функциональности этого инструмента P2P:\n\n- **Списки контроля доступа (ACL)**: Внедрение контроля доступа на основе пользователей для разрешения различных уровней разрешений. Это позволит системным администраторам, разработчикам и конечным пользователям.взаимодействуйте с конкретными роботами или функциональностью в соответствии с их ролью.\n- **Оптимизированный поток данных**: Реализация прямых ссылок после начального обнаружения через libP2P для улучшения производительности видеопотока, оптимизация доступной полосы пропускания для случаев использования видео.\n\n### Будьте в курсе\n\nЭтот пост является частью нашей постоянной серии, посвященной разработке современного программного обеспечения для робототехники. Будущие статьи будут включать обсуждения интеграции PKI в робототехнику, эффективные стратегии CI/CD и лучшие практики интеграции этого инструмента с ROS 2 (Robot Operating System). Для разработчиков, заинтересованных в создании распределенных систем, управлении сетями робототехники или расширении возможностей флота, этот инструмент разработан для предоставления ценности и упрощения ваших операций. Мы призываем вас исследовать репозиторий с открытым исходным кодом и внести свой вклад в его развитие. Мы будем рады получить ваш отзыв на Github или Discord.\n\n**Начните**: Получите доступ к нашему репозиторию с открытым исходным кодом [здесь](https://github.com/airalab/otaberu) и следуйте

2024","description":"Today, we live in a world where we rely more on technology more than ever before, the fear of being disconnected is real, and it’s only growing. With the number of smart, useful devices set to skyrocket in the next five years, the idea of “cutting the digital umbilical cord” from corporate clouds and surviving sounds impossible.","content":"\n\nToday, we live in a world where we rely more on technology more than ever before, the fear of being disconnected is real, and it’s only growing. With the number of smart, useful devices set to skyrocket in the next five years, the idea of “cutting the digital umbilical cord” from corporate clouds and surviving sounds impossible.   \nBut the engineers at Robonomics know how to guide you toward a self-sovereign digital life where your tech only answers to you.\n\n**The event consists of three key elements:**\n\n**AI Agent “Tyler Durden”** – Your personal guide to unplugging from corporate clouds.\n\n**Season Pass: “Monkey Astronaut”** – Your access pass to the Paper St. Club, and once activated you’ll earn achievements and participate in exclusive community events.\n\n**Achievement System “The Digital Freedom Hall of Fame”** – Track your and the community's progress and try to become a part of the next generation of digital autonomy, a virtual Martian colony.\n\n## The Paper St. Club   \nYes, we’re referencing Fight Club. Just like Tyler Durden’s frustration with the consumer culture, today’s world is even more complex. We’re not just losing ourselves to materialism, but to corporate-controlled technology. Afraid of surrendering your life to centralized systems? It’s already happening, worse yet, we’re balancing on the edge of digital enslavement, with tech giants like Amazon pulling the strings. We’re here for those daring enough to experiment and reclaim their digital freedom.\n\nFor years, our team has developed a complete chain of open-source solutions; from software to hardware devices that empower you to break and live free from corporate cloud control. For the first time, you’ll have the chance to join us in reshaping our digital spaces.\n\nTogether, we’ll share experiences, compete, and host exclusive offline events. This is your invitation to the basement at Paper St., but you’ll need your “Monkey Astronaut” card to get in.\n\n## AI Coach “Tyler Durden”   \nNothing supernatural here, just the magic of AI. We will create an AI agent, loaded with Tyler Durden’s rebellious spirit, and train it with a three-year development program from the Robonomics engineers. Tyler will assist all the \"Astronauts Monkey's\" in the club helping the transition to digital autonomy.\n\nTyler will assign tasks - not as eccentric as in the original work, but we hope just as interesting. The main goal is to help you achieve digital autonomy at the household level within a few months. Tyler will help you create a digital twin of your environment and monitor its status throughout the season pass duration. He’ll guide you in transitioning from corporate solutions to open-source technologies and will recognize your achievements on the club’s \"Hall of Fame.\"\n\n## Season Pass: “Monkey Astronaut”\n\n![Card-2.png](./images/robo-season-pass-2025-welcome-to-the-paper-st-club/card-2.png)\n\nEntrance to the club is by pass only. This helps us manage the workload of supporting participants. The pass not only grants you entry but includes the training and hardware devices needed for the journey with free worldwide shipping!\n\nThe starting price of the season pass is 420 DAI, available on OpenSea starting November 7, 2024.\n\n### First Offline Event for Club Members\nHeading to Bangkok from November 7 to 15? We’ve planned a [city quest inspired by Neuromancer](https://x.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1844293067009929439) by William Gibson, exclusively for season pass holders.\n\n## The Digital Freedom Hall of Fame\nAchieving digital autonomy unlocks far more than just control over your devices, it’s the gateway to the future of networked communities or the so called “network states.” The Hall of Fame will track community progress, gauging who is ready to build the first autonomous enclave under the slogan; “Who is John Galt?”\n\n## In Conclusion  \nThis is going to be an exhilarating experience. Choose the months that work best for you in 2025, activate your season pass, and let Tyler guide you. At the very least, you’ll understand the digital shadows your personal devices cast. At best, you’ll become one of the 0.001% truly free people in the modern world.\n\n“It’s only after we’ve lost everything that we’re free to do anything.”   \n*See you at the Paper St. Club,\nSergey, Architect of Robonomics.*","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/png","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.5e4f68fb331b6800bd1fba1456968ddb.png","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width:

Instead of the traditional red ribbon, we decided to showcase the longest open-source chain of 2024, built on a RISC-V architecture computer. We hope that this launch demo will spark great interest within the Polkadot ecosystem!","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nLPJPQhsdEY\n\n## The Longest open source Chain of 2024!   \n\nWhat you saw at the beginning of the video (turning on the light from a phone) is a unique example of a fully open-source solution covering all stages of interaction between a person and a smart device. To date, this is the only experiment successfully demonstrating a hybrid (cloud-local) and fully integrated IoT solution, entirely built on open-source technologies!\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/robojam-to-celebrate-robonomics-launch-on-polk/risk-v_infocrafic-2.jpg\" alt=\"RISC-V Infographics\" />\n\n1. The light switch operates on the open-source Tasmota firmware and is built using open blueprints from Robonomics Hardware.   \n2. It is connected to the smart home server, based on RISC-V architecture, via the open-source MQTT protocol implementation — Mosquitto. RISC-V is one of the few open architectures for single-board computers that is actively evolving.   \n3. The RISC-V computer runs Linux and Home Assistant, creating a local smart home system. Home Assistant is the most popular open-source smart home project in the world! As for Linux, no further explanation is needed.   \n4. Thanks to the integration of Robonomics with Home Assistant, the smart home is connected to Polkadot. The Robonomics engineers have assembled all the necessary dependencies to enable the RISC-V computer to communicate with the Polkadot parachain. After activating the subscription, the smart home server created a digital twin on the Robonomics parachain within Polkadot.   \n5. The user accessed the Robonomics Dapp via Nova Wallet and, using self-generated keys, sent the \"Robonomics Jam\" command.   \n6. The smart home server, integrated with Robonomics, detected changes in the digital twin and performed the corresponding actions in the physical world.   \n\nAll elements of the demo — from the user application and connection services to the cloud and home devices — are fully open-source and built with the Robonomics platform!  \n\n## Robonomics open source Platform: Full Stack DePIN for the Polkadot Ecosystem   \n\nDuring our time in the Polkadot ecosystem, the Robonomics team has published 25 significant repositories,  215 releases, and made around 20,000 code commits that can benefit the community. Among our pinned repositories, you'll find not only the network node's source code but also software solutions for connecting devices and robots directly to decentralized user applications built on Polkadot!  \n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/robojam-to-celebrate-robonomics-launch-on-polk/image.png\" alt=\"Robonomics GitHub\" />  \n\nIn future publications, we will take a closer look at how developers in the Polkadot ecosystem can integrate the Robonomics platform into their projects.   \n\n## How Much Activity Was Generated on the Kusama Network   \n\nWe are embarking on our journey in Polkadot with nearly three years of experience in experiments and real-world projects on the Kusama network. Over the 1006 days of the Robonomics parachain's existence on Kusama (since January 9, 2022), more than 80% of all extrinsics contained meaningful data: device activations, telemetry publications, or changes to the state of digital twins. In total, Robonomics-based projects generated over 5 million extrinsics. We also tested interactions with six other parachains, resulting in about 3,000 transactions. Additionally, we gained valuable experience in on-chain governance, processing 294 technical committee proposals and 25 treasury requests.\n\nThank you, Kusama, for the time we’ve spent together. The Kusama network will continue to play an important role in Robonomics solutions as the platform for Freemium smart home subscriptions.   \n\n## The Journey is Made by Those Who Walk It   \n\nWe will continue to uphold the spirit of open source at Robonomics, building an open and accessible network for engineers and enthusiasts who are ready to take on exciting and complex challenges. Our next step is launching the first products for end users, based on the Robonomics platform. This will not only showcase the power of our code but also create a load on Polkadot that far exceeds that of Kusama, helping the ecosystem integrate Robonomics solutions into any applications built on Polkadot.\n\nStay tuned for updates on the \"Hardware for Cyberpunks 2025\" project!   \n\nThank you to everyone who has supported us over the years!\n\n*Architect of Robonomics*   \n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/twitter-blog-jam.62c183a.e7fe367a44d6054e1ccf9087eb6df559.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/twitter-blog-jam.9ea8d39.e7fe367a44d6054e1ccf9087eb6df559.jpg 480w","/assets/static/twitter-blog-jam.6b2ed88.e7fe367a44d6054e1ccf9087eb6df559.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/twitter-blog-jam.62c183a.e7fe367a44d6054e1ccf9087eb6df559.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-06550ad268250a4cceecf30e09a707b9'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-06550ad268250a4cceecf30e09a707b9)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQcDBgECBAj/xAAyEAABAwIEBAIIBwAAAAAAAAABAgMEABEFEiExBhMiUUFhBxQVQnGBkaEkMjNSVZTR/8QAGQEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQABQcC/8QAJxEAAgIBAwIFBQAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAEITESQQVRYZGxEyKBweH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/APPfKV2NXLA8K4dclycOxVUtuQhaA06AoKWCOvpsbW3GmtCozDT6FnO2kp8FEAn4URQ8%2bpklLiMwP6xsHNrWzb2tVnFJDIQUcH0JziUukLxzqyXX3KATW9gE7Anzr5wUMJhutlxh6etGZSQpMXMDZVvA9in5moJEGDHul2XJbdTopDkXIU/HXejzM%2bdh7bTLDqW0KGRIShOv230GvlTQ9G/C3OlQMdluLmYnMlBizTecQkZVha3kFOpICctiKNII1UkGyMqYJtS8nSxoHji%2bfLpxAONjmLDKitu5CV2tcd7VjlL7V6B9KHA6Jb2I4gi8fEY8kRwl5HKRPRlSEFlIFgoEqzXPh8qV0/hvEMPnuw5cJ1DrdjcALSq/ZSbg%2bII3FBR4WYIXAY9rF47JqJIwSVJA5NfOU7lK7Vnlq/bVrZwOQ6%2bhoMqSpZsMwtbzqfGsB9muMgklDgsCRsoAXFxpvt5URvoo4jZxZ9ciTzSRNOkZKrya2GPX2Bg/8TA/ro/yld6XYTUPEcPQxBZhwQjMXmmCEqUSbglI3AAsD3psKkke6PrUC5y03sn71mWm1o08gkO9Zomp0TamMxg1eK1zD483AcPnY1PmxzEK2mEKaC3H2/zBQBPT4gKOlkjtTY4O40hs8ORJU5t2MXngUzXVJbXk06cl%2bra2m/hQiY8iQ5nkNB1OUJ5bllINjcGxG471w4nyMRcQuZHQ6UC1lHQjsfKml8ZiBBYdz%2bL7Dj3vFG8EnIPQ3l3q67nn2rLBxHxJDxqbNjfjn2nOjOG73uLkAX08vKhbnrURhDDEJ52LIaLS7ultbZ1sdDmKym%2bumttReo2MRdj39XS01chRCUDUgW7dgK0VOkK9/wClV2s1kE56lBs8/wAN49B4VMo6ZGG2wI5r12zqw94R0Yfhk5S5riEBtx19F8xB0CzqSSLbE7G5oymPFbcUtCGQsm5OUVWVSXju4qtC4s7rV9aDJrQwAAr947FoGSwWvP/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics won the Polkadot auction #75 – What's next!","path":"/blog/robonomics-won-75-polkadot-auction/","date":"July 20, 2024","description":"Robonomics has won a Polkadot Parachain slot auction and will be connected to the Polkadot Relay chain starting September 25, 2024. Below are the launch plans, what will happen with the parachain on the Kusama network, and what we aim to achieve during the slot lease over the next 2 years.","content":"\n## Launch of the Robonomics Parachain in Polkadot\n\nThe past two years of Robonomics' presence on the Kusama network have been extremely beneficial: we tested the operation of the Web3 cloud for IoT in numerous R&D projects with 5 million+ transactions through the parachain over 2 years; delivered a dozen updates with the help of the technical committee; experimented with managing the treasury in the DAO format of token holders; and acquired many other skills important for the project's development in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n[Launching the production of our own IoT devices](https://x.com/RobonomicsHW) under the Robonomics brand, the emergence of [the first multi-apartment building projects with Robonomics technologies in Cyprus](https://robonomics.network/blog/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/), and of course the maturation of the Polkadot ecosystem itself - all of these things have led to the decision for the project to push to be connected to the Polkadot Relay Chain.\n\nThe process of launching a parachain on Polkadot will be very similar to how Robonomics was initiated in Kusama, but there will still be differences due to the existing parachain in Kusama:\n\n1. The launch on Polkadot does not mean stopping the parachain on Kusama. Kusama will be a network for obtaining free IoT subscriptions, while Polkadot will allow you to purchase a monthly pro-subscription for XRT.\n2. Collators can now decide which network they will support - Kusama, Polkadot, or both. Both  parachains on Kusama and on Polkadot will offer the same rewards for block preparation in XRT.\n3. The ability to purchase a pro-subscription for XRT will appear after testing the bridge between Kusama <> Polkadot.\n4. The XRT treasury will be transferred from Kusama to the Polkadot network.\n5. The technical committee that helped ensure the operation of the parachain in Kusama will undertake a similar task for Polkadot.\n6. Name registrars for addresses will operate in parallel for now - the current one for the Kusama parachain, and a new registrar will be created for Polkadot.\n7. The ability to activate a free subscription in Kusama will appear following the implementation of the ability to activate RWS tokens, which in turn is awaiting the bridge to Ethereum.\n\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/robonomics-won-75-polkadot-auction/infographic-Robonomics-Subscription-in-Polkadot.jpg\" alt=\"Infographics Robonomics Subscription in Polkadot\" />\n\nThe launch of the Robonomics parachain on Polkadot will be an interesting event, representing the start of a multi relay chain project with unified tokenomics. Establishing the Robonomics parachain in Polkadot will involve testing system on BridgeHub, making them part of the architecture. Importantly, Polkadot will introduce the oldest project in the DePIN field, bringing new application scenarios to the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n## What will happen to the Robonomics parachain on Kusama?\n\nThe Robonomics parachain on the Kusama network has processed more than 5 million extrinsics to date and has been used in dozens of R&D projects to connect robots and smart devices over the past 2 years.\n\nThe project team does not plan to stop the parachain on the Kusama network but wants to turn it into an opportunity to create a free version of the Web3 cloud for smart homes for users. You can read more on my Twitter: [Freemium Pattern to Rescue Kusama](https://x.com/EnsRationis/status/1742535268492615983).\n\nThe Robonomics parachain on the Kusama network will be subsidized by the project’s developers, will have a bridge to the Polkadot network to allow switching from a free plan to a paid one, and the developers do not plan to completely abandon the maintenance and further support of the Kusama network. I want to emphasize once again that Kusama is a great place to create free versions of your products for any project in the Polkadot ecosystem, and I urge teams to subsidize free versions of their products within the Kusama network! It is inexpensive and will provide greater security than your own testnet, and users will get a real product instead of a toy.\n\n## Robonomics Plans for the Next 2 Years in the Polkadot Network\n\nConnecting to Polkadot opens up opportunities for Robonomics to build XCM communication with other existing projects in the ecosystem, which can expand the functionality of Robonomics and improve the project's tokenomics. We plan to integrate with at least 5 parachains by the end of the current year.\n\nThe second important element of establishing on the Polkadot Relay Chain for Robonomics will be the launch of commercial services, which the team avoided during its existence in the Kusama network. The first commercial Roboservice, under the hood of which will be Polkadot, will launch in October 2024, and by the end of the year [we expect the first users in Cyprus](https://robonomics.network/blog/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/), who have purchased new apartments with smart home features.\n\nThirdly, we want to pay more attention to the topic of on-chain governance in management issues of the DePIN infrastructure and Network States topic, as new interesting questions may arise in this direction, such as managing street lighting or making decisions based on public sensor networks. The Robonomics team will try to be more active around scenarios where the world of IoT will be part of collective online decision-making.

Interested? Check out the rules for the game 'Hack Johnny's lab'!","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n\n## Motivation for The Game\n\nThis game draws a lot of inspiration from the ideas about escaping from Black Mirror, which Sergei talked about in his articles ([first](https://robonomics.academy/en/learn/escape-from-black-mirror/overview/) and [second](https://robonomics.academy/en/learn/school-2024-iot-vs-ai/overview/)) at Robonomics Academy.\n\nImagine, an ordinary cheap robot vacuum cleaner has a serious ability to spy on the lives of its owners. It does not even matter whether some malicious person gains access to this data; AI analysis of video recordings is enough to draw conclusions about non-public aspects of a person’s life. Any dirty secrets, unnoticeable patterns of behavior, and private information — everything goes into the profile furnace. Think about it, while you are trying to grab some free tokens.\n\n## The Goal of The Game\n\nIn the game, players are tasked to restore the seed phrase from the data of the mobile robot. The robot moves randomly around the laboratory, recording video. From time to time, the robot publishes one of the 12 seed phrase words. During one of the robot’s stops, players can see on the video a sign with a number, which hints at the order of that word in the seed phrase. The task is to match the numbers on the signs with the set of words received at the robot's stops, to restore the correct seed phrase.\n\nThe player who first restores the seed phrase and withdraws all XRT tokens from its address wins.\n\n## The Game Rules\n\n*Registration of players*\n\n- To participate, players have to create a new account on the Robonomics parachain, and it must be created with the Edwards (ed25519) encryption type. Instructions are available on [our wiki](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/create-account-in-dapp/).\n- Next, players need to go to the [Discord bot](https://discordapp.com/channels/803947358492557312/1245395009964871772) on the Robonomics server and wait for a message about the start of a new session.\n- At the start of the session, players send the created account addresses in **Robonomics parachain format** to the Discord bot. Players will have 60 minutes to enter.\n\n*Laboratory exploration*\n\n- After the registration is complete, the mobile robot will go to explore the laboratory. After that, the robot will send a video recording and a list of the words in the seed phrase (not in the correct order).\n- Players are waiting for a message from the Discord bot about receiving results from the robot and go to the application [via a link](https://robonomics.academy/en/demoapps/johnnyb-lab/) to start restoring the seed phrase.\n\n*Restoring the Seed Phrase*\n\n- To access the data, players have to use the registered Robonomics account.\n- Players will have access to the video recording and the set of seed phrase words. The player's task is to find the correct order of the words based on the numbers on the signs located in the laboratory.\n\n<Card alignContent=\"left\">\n\n**Example.** If the set of words: \n\n`finding -> church -> relation -> dog -> sample`\n\nAnd the robot's route, reconstructed from the video: \n\n`Sign #5 -> Sign #3 -> Sign #1 -> Sign #2 -> Sign #4`\n\nThen:\n\n`finding — Sign #5 -> finding is 5th word`\n\n`church — Sign #3 -> church is 3rd word`\n\n`relation — Sign #1 -> relation is 1st word`\n\n`dog — Sign #2 -> dog is 2nd word`\n\n`sample — Sign #4 -> sample is 4th word`\n\nAs a result, the correct seed phrase: `relation dog church sample finding`\n\n</Card>\n\n\n- After finding the seed phrase, players can restore access to the account with tokens using any application.\n- For example, in the Polkadot.js extension, this can be done using the *Import account from pre-existing seed* function.\n- All restored account with XRTs have **an Schnorrkel (sr25519)** encryption type, that supported in most Polkadot / Kusama wallets.\n\n\n*Announcement of the winner*\n\n- Once a player has accessed the account, he or she has to withdraw XRT to become the winner of the session, until someone else does it.\n- For example, using the Polkadot.js extension, this can be done on [our Polkadot / Substrate portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/accounts) on the Account page. Just press Send button and withdrawn tokens to any place you want. You can use *Transfer the full account balance, reap the sender* check to make full balance withdrawal.\n- Upon completion of the session, after the tokens are withdrawn, the bot will notify the Discord channel by publishing the winner's address.\n\n## Event Conditions\n\nThe event will last 9 days, during which in the morning and evening (18 times in total) you will have the opportunity to be the first to reach **42 XRT** within each session.\n\nThe registration for session is started at **10:00 and 20:00 EEST** every day and last 60 minutes.\n\nFollow our social networks so you do not miss the start of the event!","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.26e750acf55da7d69cd6ab4f25cd5b93.jpeg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.26e750acf55da7d69cd6ab4f25cd5b93.jpeg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.26e750acf55da7d69cd6ab4f25cd5b93.jpeg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.26e750acf55da7d69cd6ab4f25cd5b93.jpeg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-9ea6ba3c7907dca498a0ebe0e278f553'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-9ea6ba3c7907dca498a0ebe0e278f553)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQYBBAACBwj/xAAvEAABAwMCBAMHBQAAAAAAAAABAgMEAAUREiEGE0FRFCIxBxUyYXGB0SNSksHw/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwIE/8QAJhEAAQMDAwMFAQAAAAAAAAAAAQACEQMSITFBYQRRcSIkUoHB8f/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A88IXGEBxCm1GUXAUrzsE9abuB%2bEPfzCFCOuU%2b9zC014lLCQlBAUSo9cqSAPnn0zShPLBmPGGCI5V5Ae1NdtbudstMRMmFHkwJQLzTatLnm0Eg6cgg7jO%2b46ZrXS6ihQq%2b4ggSOPO0ozTe6mXtmBk8D8QS%2bwvc9zZVDW4ltaEvsleNSQc%2buNjuDv1qpLhzEx0TZKFFt851k5JJ71evbd0nTG35sVTS3VJaTkBKcnYJHQDbYdKl5F5egIgLYUpppWAAN9sAb9txRu6jpXF/qhurRIieUAqgBpDhznZD4FvemhxTZbQ22MqW4rSkVDTYfnMx1JB3DQ5QxqOcA798%2btEuFUQ3ZExi7OSW4vh3HP0GuYeYndII6A4Iz0rfh22uzYsy5cjnx2yGlJbI15UCcpT12GD9R3oAToteENucPwk4xdDiHknStDowUn7/WtLnCet8nwz60KUAFeRWQM/3RG82ya1bGLhIhy2ozjqm23n2igLP7Rn1x3/ABQUFJ1Fwqzjy43yfnVtLbSIz3lSZmdlKV6W1o0IJVjzEbpx2q2zLkvoQw8%2b64y0kltClEhGwG3bbarbMFg8MPzFJJf5oSk5%2bEUGqq9BzA27cSPuVLKl4cGmNiia2skZaOfXGlZ3/lUJQSAdKuitOFEAd/i%2b9DcDtWYHas1h7rRe34o1brnNscoyre2yAQAoOshxCuoylRIOOn1pr4a4jl8Q8TLduKGGI6WSpTcJlLSQfKAdPp/jXOsUc4Yu7sK6J1IDiXmxHIzpKR0IpGiBlQ4ycBOHtOcmM2OLGkTUriLkcyNHU4CsJwfPpGdI3A3Ocmudw5C4UlqQhCVKTunWnIPzpi9ooPvppWduSABj0wT%2baASbg9JhxozgRy44IQQMH704qAm%2bYIiIG4j%2b%2bURaYt1B1X//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Data Harvester Project: April Report","path":"/blog/data-harvester-report-april-2024/","date":"April 11, 2024","description":"The Robonomics team is developing the idea of an autonomous platform for data harvesting.

In its simplest form, this is a mobile robotic platform equipped with sensors, intended to gather available data about its surroundings. In our scenario, we use the [Turtlebot 4 Pro](https://clearpathrobotics.com/turtlebot-4/), manufactured by Clearpath Robotics, equipped with a 3D camera, 2D lidar, and a set of standard sensors for wheeled robots. The central computing unit is the Raspberry Pi. All components of the robot communicating via the ROS 2 framework.\n\nThe objective is to convert the robot into a data harvesting machine, collecting secure information about the indoor environment and presenting it in a user-friendly format. To achieve this, additional sensors are integrated with the basic recording devices, and software is developed to facilitate comprehensive data collection from these sensors.\n\n## Turtlebot 4 Pro Hardware Update\n\nInitially, a set of air sensors based on the ESP32 controller was integrated into the robot. These sensors include:\n\n- SHT3X: temperature and humidity sensor\n- BH1750: light intensity sensor\n- SCD4X: carbon dioxide concentration sensor\n\nFurthermore, the robot's fundamental setup underwent slight enhancements to accommodate increased computational demands and safety considerations:\n\n- The Raspberry Pi 4GB was upgraded to the more potent 8GB version.\n- A 3D-printed case was crafted to house the air sensors, ensuring their compact arrangement.\n- A protective frame for the camera and lidar was also 3D-printed.\n- Additionally, the robot is now encased in warning tape for enhanced visibility.\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/data-harvester-report-april-2024/upgraded-turtle-bot-4-pro.jpg\" alt=\"Upgraded Turtle Bot 4 pro\" />\n\n## Software Development Progress\n\nThe Turtlebot comes with a set of default packages for basic operations, including simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and navigation. However, the task remains to integrate these modules for unified functionality and incorporate specific features for data harvesting. In the current setup, the robot is expected to gather data from air sensors and scan Wi-Fi networks.\n\nCurrently, three main ROS 2 packages have been developed for the robot:\n\n- **data_harvester_navigation** - handles localization and navigation of the robot on a pre-existing map constructed with SLAM.\n- **data_harvester_perception** - responsible for publishing data from air sensors and conducting Wi-Fi network scans.\n- **data_harvester_chronicler** - manages data logging and subsequent publication to the final archive.\n\nFor the ESP32 controller, the firmware ```esp32-sensors``` was written based on the ESP-IDF framework with support for all used sensors. The firmware is available in two versions: an online version (with the controller connected to Wi-Fi) and an offline version.\n\nThe source code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/Fingerling42/data-harvester\n\n## Field Engineering and Testing\n\nSince the beginning of March, experimental trips have been made with the robot. The object of the field testing is an office space in Paphos, Cyprus. After the initial setup, the robot was left in the office, and its control began to be carried out remotely, using a connection through the end-to-end Yggdrasil protocol.\n\nFirstly, several SLAM laps were made around the office territory. As a result, a sufficiently high-quality map of the studied area was formed.\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/data-harvester-report-april-2024/turtle-bot-map-testing.png\" alt=\"Turtle Bot map testing\" caption=\"A map of an office space with an overlay of robot coordinates after one of the missions\" />\n\nThen, based on the map, the robot embarked on a mission to collect data. After its completion, data about air quality and Wi-Fi signal quality were collected along with data about the robot's location on the map. This allowed the harvested data to be combined with the points where they were collected. In the end, the final archive was sent for processing and visualization.\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/data-harvester-report-april-2024/turtle-bot-4-app-1.png\" alt=\"Turtle Bot application air sensor data\" caption=\"UI for the data collected from the air sensors installed on Turtlebot 4 Pro\" />\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/data-harvester-report-april-2024/turtle-bot-4-app-2.png\" alt=\"Turtle Bot application wi-fi coverage\" caption=\"UI for Wi-Fi coverage analytics based on data collected from the upgraded Turtlebot 4 Pro\" />\n\n## Next Milestones\n\nOur next focus will be on developing comprehensive coverage path planning for the robot's complete traversal of the area, utilizing the Backtracking Spiral Algorithm that has already been selected. Additionally, integration with the latest version of the Robonomics ROS 2 Wrapper will be implemented to securely transmit data to the Robonomics cloud from ROS 2.\n\nOn the hardware front, we plan to incorporate a dedicated router into the robot to ensure simplicity and independence in network connections for all components.\n\nUltimately, our aim is to create a dedicated Data Harvester UI application, allowing collected data to be presented in a user-friendly format. This could prove invaluable, especially for office administrators.\n\nStay tuned for further updates!","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/png","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.a129d1766fc88e2b1ae9fca6c278268c.png","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px)

apartment is the most intimate place. It’s unlikely that you would be comfortable knowing that all your data ends up on a server somewhere outside your home. In this project, each apartment is equipped with a home server with Home Assistant.","content":"\nHello everyone!\n\nMy name is Vadim Manaenko. I am a co-founder of Pinout LTD and one of the key developers in the [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/) project. Today I want to share with you big news: Pinout LTD has signed a contract with the developer [CCS](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/) for the automation of 28 apartments and common area in the [Residence 28](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/property/residence-28) building. Work will begin in 2024.\n\n## About the Project\n\nThe developer CCS has been operating on the market since 1997 and has built more than 600 properties. The Residence 28 project is located in Limassol, Cyprus. The building will consist of two blocks with a total living area (covered part) of about 1800 m2. This will be the first apartment building in Cyprus with a smart home system built on Zigbee wireless devices controlled by the open source [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) software, remote access will be provided via the Robonomics Parachain Web3 cloud.\n\n## What Will Future Residents Receive?\n\nBelow is a floor plan of one of the two blocks and a designation legend.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home floor plan](./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home floor plan\" />\n\nDon't be confused by the word \"Wired\". This means that the device requires constant power, while the devices in the “Wireless” column are battery operated.\n\nWhat new will the installation of all these devices bring to apartments?\n\nSmart switches will allow residents to control lighting both in the usual way and through a smartphone application, set up schedules and scenarios. For example, while in the bedroom, you can turn off the lights in the entire apartment or create the atmosphere for the evening with a defined scene.\n\nProgrammable IR remote controls can handle multiple devices from one location. For example, turning on the air conditioner on a schedule or to maintain a set temperature in the room.\n\nCurtains can be tied to your alarm clock to make waking up a more pleasant experience.\n\nA smart boiler button will allow you to set the schedule once and no longer think about hot water in the winter.\n\nVarious sensors will give you complete information about the place where you live. Are all your doors and windows closed, what is the temperature and humidity in the nursery, how much electricity do you consume and for what, is there a water leak somewhere.\n\nFor greater comfort for residents, Pinout engineers will create seamless Internet within the apartment so that you have no dead zones.\n\n## Common Area\n\nThe building would not be called smart if the matter was limited only to automation inside the apartment. In a common area, smart relays will monitor the time of sunrise and sunset in order to turn on street lighting when it is really needed, without wasting resources. Lights in the lobby and staircases will turn on only when movement is detected.\n\nRegarding security, residents will have access to the intercom system from a single home control panel. We will also install CCTV cameras for security.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home lobby plan](./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home lobby plan\" />\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDo you have the feeling that all this has already happened somewhere? Smart houses and apartments have been built for decades. So what new are Pinout engineers doing?\n\nYour apartment is the most intimate place. It’s unlikely that you would be comfortable knowing that all your data ends up on a server somewhere outside your home. In this project, each apartment is equipped with a home server with Home Assistant. This software allows you to combine all devices into a single system, and all data will remain inside your apartment.\n\nThis way we get rid of delays in transmitting commands over the global Internet. If I’m at home and press “turn off the lights,” there’s no point in sending a signal somewhere and waiting for a response.\n\nMoreover, Home Assistant itself will understand that a new smart device has appeared, for example, a TV or a robot vacuum cleaner, and will offer to add it. You yourself can expand the smart home system and customize automation to suit your habits.\n\nResidence 28 is not just a new residential complex with automation. This is a smart home that easily adapts to your life.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px)

كبيرة معكم: قامت شركة Pinout LTD بتوقيع عقد مع المطور [CCS](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/) لتطوير 28 شقة ومنطقة مشتركة في مبنى [Residence 28](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/property/residence-28). ستبدأ الأعمال في عام 2024.\n\n## حول المشروع\n\nتعمل شركة المطور CCS في السوق منذ عام 1997 وقد قامت ببناء أكثر من 600 عقار. يقع مشروع Residence 28 في ليماسول، قبرص. سيتكون المبنى من كتلتين بمساحة سكنية إجمالية (الجزء المغطى) تبلغ حوالي 1800 متر مربع. سيكون هذا أول مبنى سكني في قبرص يحتوي على نظام منزل ذكي مبني على أجهزة لاسلكية Zigbee يتم التحكم فيها بواسطة برنامج مفتوح المصدر [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)، وسيتم توفير الوصول عن بعد عبر سحابة Robonomics Parachain Web3.\n\n## ماذا سيحصل السكان المستقبليون؟\n\nفيما يلي خطة الطابق لإحدى الكتلتين وأسطورة التعيين.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home floor plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home floor plan\" />\n\nلا تتردد في الخلط بسبب كلمة \"موصل\". هذا يعني أن الجهاز يحتاج إلى طاقة مستمرة، بينما الأجهزة في عمود \"لاسلكي\" تعمل بالبطارية.\n\nما الجديد الذي ستجلبه تركيب جميع هذه الأجهزة إلى الشقق؟\n\nسيتيح للسكان الأفراد التحكم في الإضاءة بطريقة عادية وعبر تطبيق الهاتف الذكي، وإعداد الجداول الزمنية والسيناريوهات. على سبيل المثال، يمكنك إيقاف تشغيل الأضواء في الشقة بأكملها أثناء وجودك في غرفة النوم أو إنشاء أجواء المساء بمشهد محدد.\n\nيمكن للأجهزة البعيدة التحكم في الأجهزة المتعددة من موقع واحد. على سبيل المثال، تشغيل مكيف الهواء وفقًا لجدول زمني أو للحفاظ على درجة حرارة محددة في الغرفة.\n\nيمكن ربط الستائر بساعة المنبه الخاصة بك لجعل تجربة الاستيقاظ أكثر متعة.\n\nزر الغلاية الذكية سيتيح لك ضبط الجدول مرة واحدة وعدم التفكير بعد الآن في الماء الساخن في فصل الشتاء.\n\nسوف توفر لك مجموعة متنوعة من الحساسات معلومات كاملة عن المكان الذي تعيش فيه. هل جميع الأبواب والنوافذ مغلقة، ما هي درجة الحرارة والرطوبة في حجرة الأطفال، كمية الكهرباء التي تستهلكها ولأي غرض، هل هناك تسرب للماء في مكان ما.\n\nلراحة أكبر للسكان، ستقوم مهندسو Pinout بإنشاء شبكة إنترنت سلسة داخل الشقة بحيث لا توجد مناطق ميتة.\n\n## منطقة مشتركة\n\nلن يكون البناء ذكيًا إذا كان الأمر مقتصرًا فقط على التشغيل التلقائي داخل الشقة. في المناطق المشتركة، ستراقب الأجهزة الذكية وقت شروق وغروب الشمس لتشغيل إضاءة الشوارع عندما يكون ذلك ضروريًا، دون إهدار الموارد. ستشتعل الأضواء في اللوبي والسلالم فقط عندما يتم اكتشاف الحركة.\n\nبالنسبة للأمان، سيتمكن السكان من الوصول إلى نظام الانتركم من لوحة التحكم المنزلية الواحدة. سنقوم أيضًا بتركيب كاميرات مراقبة للأمان.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home lobby plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home lobby plan\" />\n\n## الاستنتاج\n\nهل لديك الشعور بأن كل هذا قد حدث في مكان ما من قبل؟ تم بناء المنازل والشقق الذكية منذ عقود. فما الجديد الذي يقوم به مهندسو Pinout؟\n\nشقتك هي أكثر الأماكن حميمية. من غير المرجح أن تشعر بالراحة عندما تعلم أن جميع بياناتك تنتهي على خادم ما خارج منزلك. في هذا المشروع، يتم تجهيز كل شقة بخادم منزلي يحتوي على Home Assistant. هذا البرنامج يسمح لك بدمج جميع الأجهزة في نظام واحد، وسيبقى جميع البيانات داخل شقتك.\n\nبهذه الطريقة نتخلص من التأخير في نقل الأوامر عبر الإنترنت العالمي. إذا كنت في المنزل وقمت بالضغط على \"أطفئ الأنوار\"، فلا فائدة من إرسال إشارة إلى مكان ما وانتظار الرد.\n\nعلاوة على ذلك، سيفهم Home Assistant نفسه أن جهازًا ذكيًا جديدًا قد ظهر، على سبيل المثال، تلفزيون أو مكنسة كهربائية ذكية، وسيقترح إضافته. يمكنك بنفسك توسيع نظام المنزل الذكي وتخصيص الأتمتة لتناسب عاداتك.\n\nResidence 28 ليس مجرد مجمع سكني جديد مع أتمتة. إنه منزل ذكي يتكيف بسهولة مع حياتك.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px)

Ich bin Mitbegründer von Pinout LTD und einer der Hauptentwickler des [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/) Projekts. Heute möchte ich Ihnen eine große Neuigkeit mitteilen: Pinout LTD hat einen Vertrag mit dem Entwickler [CCS](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/) für die Automatisierung von 28 Wohnungen und Gemeinschaftsbereichen im Gebäude [Residence 28](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/property/residence-28) unterzeichnet. Die Arbeiten beginnen 2024.\n\n## Über das Projekt\n\nDer Entwickler CCS ist seit 1997 auf dem Markt tätig und hat mehr als 600 Immobilien gebaut. Das Projekt Residence 28 befindet sich in Limassol, Zypern. Das Gebäude besteht aus zwei Blöcken mit einer Gesamtwohnfläche (überdachter Teil) von etwa 1800 m2. Dies wird das erste Apartmentgebäude in Zypern sein, das auf Zigbee-Funkgeräten mit der Open-Source-Software [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) als Smart-Home-System ausgestattet ist. Der Fernzugriff erfolgt über die Robonomics Parachain Web3 Cloud.\n\n## Was erhalten zukünftige Bewohner?\n\nUnten finden Sie einen Grundriss eines der beiden Blöcke und eine Legende zur Kennzeichnung.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home floor plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home floor plan\" />\n\nLassen Sie sich nicht von dem Wort \"Verkabelt\" verwirren. Dies bedeutet, dass das Gerät ständigen Strom benötigt, während die Geräte in der Spalte \"Kabellos\" batteriebetrieben sind.\n\nWas bringt die Installation all dieser Geräte in die Wohnungen?\n\nMit intelligenten Schaltern können Bewohner die Beleuchtung sowohl auf herkömmliche Weise als auch über eine Smartphone-App steuern, Zeitpläne und Szenarien einrichten. Zum Beispiel können Sie im Schlafzimmer das Licht in der gesamten Wohnung ausschalten oder eine Atmosphäre für den Abend mit einer definierten Szene schaffen.\n\nProgrammierbare IR-Fernbedienungen können mehrere Geräte an einem Ort steuern. Zum Beispiel das Einschalten der Klimaanlage nach einem Zeitplan oder das Aufrechterhalten einer bestimmten Raumtemperatur.\n\nDie Vorhänge können mit Ihrem Wecker verbunden werden, um das Aufwachen angenehmer zu gestalten.\n\nMit einer intelligenten Boiler-Taste können Sie den Zeitplan einmal festlegen und sich im Winter keine Gedanken mehr über heißes Wasser machen.\n\nVerschiedene Sensoren liefern Ihnen vollständige Informationen über den Ort, an dem Sie leben. Sind alle Türen und Fenster geschlossen, wie ist die Temperatur und Luftfeuchtigkeit im Kinderzimmer, wie viel Strom verbrauchen Sie und wofür, gibt es irgendwo einen Wasserleckage.\n\nUm den Komfort der Bewohner zu erhöhen, werden Pinout-Ingenieure eine nahtlose Internetverbindung innerhalb der Wohnung herstellen, damit Sie keine Funklöcher haben.\n\n## Gemeinschaftsbereich\n\nDas Gebäude wäre nicht intelligent, wenn es sich nur auf die Automatisierung innerhalb der Wohnung beschränken würde. In einem Gemeinschaftsbereich überwachen intelligente Relais die Sonnenaufgangs- und Sonnenuntergangszeiten, um die Straßenbeleuchtung nur dann einzuschalten, wenn sie wirklich benötigt wird, ohne Ressourcen zu verschwenden. Die Beleuchtung in der Lobby und den Treppenhäusern wird nur eingeschaltet, wenn eine Bewegung erkannt wird.\n\nWas die Sicherheit betrifft, haben Bewohner Zugang zum Gegensprechanlagensystem von einer einzigen Heimsteuerung. Wir werden auch Überwachungskameras für die Sicherheit installieren.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home lobby plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home lobby plan\" />\n\n## Fazit\n\nHaben Sie das Gefühl, dass all dies bereits irgendwo passiert ist? Smarte Häuser und Wohnungen werden seit Jahrzehnten gebaut. Was also machen die Pinout-Ingenieure Neues?\n\nIhre Wohnung ist der intimste Ort. Es ist unwahrscheinlich, dass Sie sich wohl fühlen, wenn Sie wissen, dass alle Ihre Daten auf einem Server irgendwo außerhalb Ihres Zuhauses landen. In diesem Projekt ist jede Wohnung mit einem Heimserver mit Home Assistant ausgestattet. Diese Software ermöglicht es Ihnen, alle Geräte zu einer einzigen System zu kombinieren, und alle Daten bleiben innerhalb Ihrer Wohnung.\n\nAuf diese Weise werden Verzögerungen bei der Übertragung von Befehlen über das globale Internet vermieden. Wenn ich zu Hause bin und auf \"Licht ausschalten\" drücke, hat es keinen Sinn, ein Signal irgendwohin zu senden und auf eine Antwort zu warten.\n\nDarüber hinaus erkennt Home Assistant selbst, dass ein neues intelligentes Gerät aufgetaucht ist, zum Beispiel ein Fernseher oder ein Roboterstaubsauger, und schlägt vor, es hinzuzufügen. Sie können das Smart-Home-System selbst erweitern und die Automatisierung an Ihre Gewohnheiten anpassen.\n\nResidence 28 ist nicht nur ein neues Wohnkomplex mit Automatisierung. Dies ist ein intelligentes Zuhause, das sich problemlos an Ihr Leben anpasst.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-8fed60bbd211c9371711ca43f66155a4'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-8fed60bbd211c9371711ca43f66155a4)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwUEBgABAgj/xAAsEAABAgUDAgYBBQAAAAAAAAABAgMABAURMRIhQRRRBiIyYXGBExVSkbHw/8QAGAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAAP/xAAcEQEBAQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABABECMQMSISL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/APSIBOIzSe0YMi%2bI71N33TaLGiIcbAJJCQSbE2GT7RDrLMxNU59mQe6eYWgpS5%2b0nmAUuUnZemS7E1NJefbTpWtSSrV2zvsOeYCsTO5moWJBjUJa7IVWcYZTTakiTWgqKyG/Vt5e%2bDvbmHkqCloBxYU4EgFWLm25A4ja2wbEpKgSOI5gkwpIKbqTjexgQUDg3gjsEyHvY%2bYfcKa8xPPdD0E2JcdShLubrSQRbY9/n4iSp9atQODf6iC5MPuTjbCFNpbbeY9SCSSSr3G22ITy/OM/jP1S6PWPz09l55twE/l2WkAq0JvuTj6v72gIqb6a9ISLrerqpZUyFoWNKQOCM/wT8xVGqx%2biSVPlOnS8VKmgFpIbA8nYCJPhqsu1qsS0440hpTMiptABJ8utPJ5/1o48N9i7c89ZtOTVRptVnHnXy/KKeaS0yhJugLSfUe1xfHsLw/XNqdfTLMABxcwtq6wE20pCrC1yc5tfuIqNTW/PyKJh9TN9cq6QGr8K2FybZzC8%2bNJiWnVWlGlPIqDqdWshJuAPT8Ac53hVXqYDK0%2bG6kqpSD0y%2b0pCkPrZ9erVpNrj2hwSODsMxVvCilCkoAI0rU45a3JdVf8AqHZWo3BOcxXxPlM93//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"de"}},{"node":{"title":"Κτίριο διαμερισμάτων με Home Assistant ενσωματωμένο","path":"/blog/el/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/","date":"December 8, 2023","description":"Το διαμέρισμά σας είναι ο πιο ιδιωτικός χώρος.

Είμαι ένας από τους συνιδρυτές της Pinout LTD και ένας από τους κύριους προγραμματιστές στο έργο [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/). Σήμερα θέλω να μοιραστώ μαζί σας μεγάλα νέα: Η Pinout LTD υπέγραψε συμβόλαιο με τον ανάδοχο [CCS](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/) για την αυτοματοποίηση 28 διαμερισμάτων και κοινόχρηστων χώρων στο κτίριο [Residence 28](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/property/residence-28). Η εργασία θα ξεκινήσει το 2024.\n\n## Σχετικά με το Έργο\n\nΟ προγραμματιστής CCS λειτουργεί στην αγορά από το 1997 και έχει κατασκευάσει πάνω από 600 ακίνητα. Το έργο Residence 28 βρίσκεται στη Λεμεσό, Κύπρος. Το κτίριο θα αποτελείται από δύο τετράγωνα με συνολική επιφάνεια κατοικίας (καλυμμένο μέρος) περίπου 1800 τ.μ. Αυτό θα είναι το πρώτο πολυκατοικία στην Κύπρο με ένα έξυπνο σύστημα σπιτιού που βασίζεται σε ασύρματες συσκευές Zigbee που ελέγχονται από το ανοιχτού κώδικα [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) λογισμικό, η απομακρυσμένη πρόσβαση θα παρέχεται μέσω του Robonomics Parachain Web3 cloud.\n\n## Τι θα λάβουν οι μελλοντικοί κάτοικοι;\n\nΠαρακάτω υπάρχει ένας χάρτης ενός από τα δύο τετράγωνα και ένας οδηγός σήμανσς.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home floor plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home floor plan\" />\n\nΜην μπερδεύεστε από τη λέξη \"Ενσύρματο\". Αυτό σημαίνει ότι η συσκευή απαιτεί συνεχή τροφοδοσία ρεύματος, ενώ οι συσκευές στη στήλη \"Ασύρματο\" λειτουργούν με μπαταρία.\n\nΤι νέο θα φέρει η εγκατάσταση όλων αυτών των συσκευών στα διαμερίσματα;\n\nΈξυπνες διακόπτες θα επιτρέπουν στους κατοίκους να ελέγχουν τον φωτισμό τόσο με τον συνηθισμένο τρόπο όσο και μέσω μιας εφαρμογής για smartphone, να ρυθμίζουν προγράμματα και σενάρια. Για παράδειγμα, ενώ βρίσκεστε στο υπνοδωμάτιο, μπορείτε να απενεργοποιήσετε τα φώτα σε ολόκληρο το διαμέρισμα ή να δημιουργήσετε την ατμόσφαιρα για το βράδυ με ένα καθορισμένο σκηνικό.\n\nΠρογραμματιζόμενοι τηλεχειριστήριο IR μπορεί να χειριστεί πολλές συσκευές από μια τοποθεσία. Για παράδειγμα, να ενεργοποιήσετ τον κλιματιστικό σε προγραμματισμένη ώρα ή να διατηρήσετε μια καθορισμένη θερμοκρασία στο δωμάτιο.\n\nΟι κουρτίνες μπορούν να δεθούν στο ξυπνητήρι σας για να κάνουν το ξύπνημα μια πιο ευχάριστη εμπειρία.\n\nΈνα έξυπνο κουμπί για τον λέβητα θα σας επιτρέψει να ρυθμίσετε το πρόγραμμα μία φορά και να μην σκέφτεστε πλέον για ζεστό νερό το χειμώνα.\n\nΔιάφοροι αισθητήρες θα σας δίνουν πλήρη πληροφορίες για τον χώρο όπου ζείτε. Είναι όλες οι πόρτες και τα παράθυρα κλειστά, ποια είναι η θερμοκρασία και η υγρασία στο παιδικό δωμάτιο, πόσο ηλεκτρικό ρεύμα καταναλώνετε και για τι, υπάρχει κάποια διαρροή νερού.\n\nΓια μεγαλύτερη άνεση των κατοίκων, οι μηχανικοί της Pinout θα δημιουργήσουν απρόσκοπτο διαδίκτυο μέσα στο διαμέρισμα, ώστε ν μην έχετε νεκρές ζώνες.\n\n## Κοινόχρηστος Χώρος\n\nΤο κτίριο δεν θα ονομαζόταν έξυπνο αν η υπόθεση περιοριζόταν μόνο στην αυτοματοποίηση μέσα στο διαμέρισμα. Σε έναν κοινόχρηστο χώρο, έξυπνοι ρελέ θα παρακολουθούν την ώρα ανατολής και δύσης του ηλίου για να ανάψουν τον δρόμο όταν πραγματικά χρειάζεται, χωρίς να σπαταλούν πόρους. Τα φώτα στον χώρο υποδοχής και τις σκάλες θα ανάψουν μόνο όταν ανιχνεύεται κίνηση.\n\nΌσον αφορά την ασφάλεια, οι κάτοικοι θα έχουν πρόσβαση στο σύστημα κλήσης από ένα μόνο πίνακα ελέγχου του σπιτιού. Θα εγκαταστήσουμε επίσης κάμερες CCTV για την ασφάλεια.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home lobby plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home lobby plan\" />\n\n## Συμπέρασμα\n\nΈχετε την αίσθηση ότι όλα αυτά έχουν ήδη συμβεί κάπου; Έξυπνα σπίτια και διαμερίσματα έχουν χτιστεί εδώ και δεκαετίες. Τι νέο κάνουν οι μηχανικοί της Pinout; \n\nΤο διαμέρισμά σας είναι ο πιο ιδιωτικός χώρος. Είναι απίθανο να νιώθετε άνετα γνωρίζοντας ότι όλα τα δεδομένα σας καταλήγουν σε έναν διακομιστή κάπου έξω από το σπίτι σας. Σε αυτό το έργο, κάθε διαμέρισμα είναι εξοπλισμένο με έναν διακομιστή στο σπίτι με το Home Assistant. Αυτό το λογισμικό σας επιτρέπει να συνδυάσετε όλες τις συσκευές σε ένα σύστημα και όλα τα δεδομένα θα παραμείνουν μέσα στο διαμέρισμά σας. \n\nΜε αυτόν τον τρόπο απαλλαγόμαστε από την καθυστέρηση στη μετάδοση εντολών μέσω του παγκόσμιου Διαδικτύου. Αν είμαι στο σπίτι και πατήσω το κουμπί 'σβήσιμο των φώτων', δεν έχει νόημα να στείλω ένα σήμα κάπου και να περιμένω για απάντηση. \n\nΕπιπλέον, το Home Assistant θα καταλάβει από μόνο του ότι έχει εμφανιστεί μια νέα έξυπνη συσκευή, για παράδειγμα, ένα τηλεόραση ή ένα ρομπότ ηλεκτρική σκούπα, και θα προτείνει να την προσθέσετε. Μπορείτε οι ίδιοι να επεκτείνετε το σύστημα έξυπνου σπιτιού και να προσαρμόσετε την αυτοματοποίηση σύμφωνα με τις συνήθειές σας. \n\nΤο Residence 28 δεν είναι απλώς ένα νέο συγκρότημα κατοικιών με αυτοματισμό. Αυτό είναι ένα έξυπνο σπίτι που προσαρμόζεται εύκολα στη ζωή σας.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-8fed60bbd211c9371711ca43f66155a4'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-8fed60bbd211c9371711ca43f66155a4)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwUEBgABAgj/xAAsEAABAgUDAgYBBQAAAAAAAAABAgMABAURMRIhQRRRBiIyYXGBExVSkbHw/8QAGAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAAP/xAAcEQEBAQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABABECMQMSISL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/APSIBOIzSe0YMi%2bI71N33TaLGiIcbAJJCQSbE2GT7RDrLMxNU59mQe6eYWgpS5%2b0nmAUuUnZemS7E1NJefbTpWtSSrV2zvsOeYCsTO5moWJBjUJa7IVWcYZTTakiTWgqKyG/Vt5e%2bDvbmHkqCloBxYU4EgFWLm25A4ja2wbEpKgSOI5gkwpIKbqTjexgQUDg3gjsEyHvY%2bYfcKa8xPPdD0E2JcdShLubrSQRbY9/n4iSp9atQODf6iC5MPuTjbCFNpbbeY9SCSSSr3G22ITy/OM/jP1S6PWPz09l55twE/l2WkAq0JvuTj6v72gIqb6a9ISLrerqpZUyFoWNKQOCM/wT8xVGqx%2biSVPlOnS8VKmgFpIbA8nYCJPhqsu1qsS0440hpTMiptABJ8utPJ5/1o48N9i7c89ZtOTVRptVnHnXy/KKeaS0yhJugLSfUe1xfHsLw/XNqdfTLMABxcwtq6wE20pCrC1yc5tfuIqNTW/PyKJh9TN9cq6QGr8K2FybZzC8%2bNJiWnVWlGlPIqDqdWshJuAPT8Ac53hVXqYDK0%2bG6kqpSD0y%2b0pCkPrZ9erVpNrj2hwSODsMxVvCilCkoAI0rU45a3JdVf8AqHZWo3BOcxXxPlM93//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"el"}},{"node":{"title":"Edificio de apartamentos con Home Assistant a bordo","path":"/blog/es/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/","date":"December 8, 2023","description":"Tu apartamento es el lugar más íntimo.

Soy cofundador de Pinout LTD y uno de los principales desarrolladores del proyecto [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/). Hoy quiero compartir con ustedes una gran noticia: Pinout LTD ha firmado un contrato con el desarrollador [CCS](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/) para la automatización de 28 apartamentos y áreas comunes en el edificio [Residence 28](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/property/residence-28). El trabajo comenzará en 2024.\n\n## Sobre el proyecto\n\nEl desarrollador CCS ha estado operando en el mercado desde 1997 y ha construido más de 600 propiedades. El proyecto Residence 28 está ubicado en Limassol, Chipre. El edificio estará compuesto por dos bloques con un área habitable total (parte cubierta) de aproximadamente 1800 m2. Este será el primer edificio de apartamentos en Chipre con un sistema de hogar inteligente construido con dispositivos inalámbricos Zigbee controlados por el software de código abierto [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), el acceso remoto se proporcionará a través de la nube Robonomics Parachain Web3.\n\n## ¿Qué recibirán los futuros residentes?\n\nA continuación se muestra un plano de planta de uno de los dos bloques y una leyenda de designación.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home floor plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home floor plan\" />\n\nNo se confunda con la palabra \"Cableado\". Esto significa que el dispositivo requiere alimentación constante, mientras que los dispositivos en la columna \"Inalámbrico\" funcionan con batería.\n\n¿Qué novedades traerá la instalación de todos estos dispositivos a los apartamentos?\n\nLos interruptores inteligentes permitirán a los residentes controlar la iluminación tanto de la manera habitual como a través de una aplicación para teléfonos inteligentes, configurar horarios y escenarios. Por ejemplo, mientras estás en el dormitorio, puedes apagar las luces en todo el apartamento o crear una atmósfera para la noche con una escena definida.\n\nLos controles remotos infrarrojos programables pueden manejar varios dispositivos desde una ubicación. Por ejemplo, encender el aire acondicionado según un horario o mantener una temperatura establecida en la habitación.\n\nLas cortinas se pueden vincular a tu despertador para que despertarse sea una experiencia más agradable.\n\nUn botón inteligente para la caldera te permitirá configurar el horario una vez y no tener que preocuparte por el agua caliente en invierno.\n\nVarios sensores te brindarán información completa sobre el lugar donde vives. ¿Están todas tus puertas y ventanas cerradas, cuál es la temperatura y humedad en la guardería, cuánta electricidad consumes y para qué, hay alguna fuga de agua en algún lugar?\n\nPara mayor comodidad de los residentes, los ingenieros de Pinout crearán una conexión a Internet sin interrupciones dentro del apartamento para que no haya zonas muertas.\n\n## Área común\n\nEl edificio no sería considerado inteligente si se limitara solo a la automatización dentro del apartamento. En un área común, los relés inteligentes controlarán la hora del amanecer y el atardecer para encender la iluminación de la calle cuando realmente sea necesario, sin desperdiciar recursos. Las luces en el vestíbulo y las escaleras se encenderán solo cuando se detecte movimiento.\n\nEn cuanto a la seguridad, los residentes tendrán acceso al sistema de intercomunicación desde un panel de control doméstico único. También instalaremos cámaras de seguridad.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home lobby plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home lobby plan\" />\n\n## Conclusión\n\n¿Tienes la sensación de que todo esto ya ha sucedido en algún lugar? Las casas y apartamentos inteligentes se han construido durante décadas. Entonces, ¿qué están haciendo de nuevo los ingenieros de Pinout?\n\nTu apartamento es el lugar más íntimo. Es poco probable que te sientas cómodo sabiendo que todos tus datos terminan en un servidor en algún lugar fuera de tu hogar. En este proyecto, cada apartamento está equipado con un servidor doméstico con Home Assistant. Este software te permite combinar todos los dispositivos en un solo sistema, y todos los datos permanecerán dentro de tu apartamento.\n\nDe esta manera, nos deshacemos de los retrasos en la transmisión de comandos a través de Internet. Si estoy en casa y presiono \"apagar las luces\", no tiene sentido enviar una señal a algún lugar y esperar una respuesta.\n\nAdemás, Home Assistant en sí mismo entenderá que ha aparecido un nuevo dispositivo inteligente, por ejemplo, un televisor o una aspiradora robot, y ofrecerá agregarlo. Tú mismo puedes expandir el sistema de hogar inteligente y personalizar la automatización según tus hábitos.\n\nResidence 28 no es solo un nuevo complejo residencial con automatización. Es un hogar inteligente que se adapta fácilmente a tu vida.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-8fed60bbd211c9371711ca43f66155a4'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-8fed60bbd211c9371711ca43f66155a4)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwUEBgABAgj/xAAsEAABAgUDAgYBBQAAAAAAAAABAgMABAURMRIhQRRRBiIyYXGBExVSkbHw/8QAGAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAAP/xAAcEQEBAQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABABECMQMSISL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/APSIBOIzSe0YMi%2bI71N33TaLGiIcbAJJCQSbE2GT7RDrLMxNU59mQe6eYWgpS5%2b0nmAUuUnZemS7E1NJefbTpWtSSrV2zvsOeYCsTO5moWJBjUJa7IVWcYZTTakiTWgqKyG/Vt5e%2bDvbmHkqCloBxYU4EgFWLm25A4ja2wbEpKgSOI5gkwpIKbqTjexgQUDg3gjsEyHvY%2bYfcKa8xPPdD0E2JcdShLubrSQRbY9/n4iSp9atQODf6iC5MPuTjbCFNpbbeY9SCSSSr3G22ITy/OM/jP1S6PWPz09l55twE/l2WkAq0JvuTj6v72gIqb6a9ISLrerqpZUyFoWNKQOCM/wT8xVGqx%2biSVPlOnS8VKmgFpIbA8nYCJPhqsu1qsS0440hpTMiptABJ8utPJ5/1o48N9i7c89ZtOTVRptVnHnXy/KKeaS0yhJugLSfUe1xfHsLw/XNqdfTLMABxcwtq6wE20pCrC1yc5tfuIqNTW/PyKJh9TN9cq6QGr8K2FybZzC8%2bNJiWnVWlGlPIqDqdWshJuAPT8Ac53hVXqYDK0%2bG6kqpSD0y%2b0pCkPrZ9erVpNrj2hwSODsMxVvCilCkoAI0rU45a3JdVf8AqHZWo3BOcxXxPlM93//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"es"}},{"node":{"title":"Immeuble d'appartements avec Home Assistant à bord","path":"/blog/fr/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/","date":"December 8, 2023","description":"Votre appartement est l'endroit le plus intime.

Cela signifie que l'appareil nécessite une alimentation constante, tandis que les appareils de la colonne \"Sans fil\" fonctionnent sur batterie.\n\nQu'apportera l'installation de tous ces appareils aux appartements?\n\nLes interrupteurs intelligents permettront aux résidents de contrôler l'éclairage de manière traditionnelle et via une application smartphone, de programmer des horaires et des scénarios. Par exemple, lorsque vous êtes dans la chambre, vous pouvez éteindre les lumières dans tout l'appartement ou créer une atmosphère pour la soirée avec une scène définie.\n\nLes télécommandes infrarouges programmables peuvent gérer plusieurs appareils depuis un seul endroit. Par exemple, allumer la climatisation selon un horaire ou maintenir une température définie dans la pièce.\n\nLes rideaux peuvent être liés à votre réveil pour rendre le réveil plus agréable.\n\nUn bouton de chaudière intelligent vous permettra de programmer une fois l'horaire et de ne plus vous soucier de l'eau chaude en hiver.\n\nDivers capteurs vous fourniront des informations complètes sur l'endroit où vous vivez. Toutes vos portes et fenêtres sont-elles fermées, quelle est la température et l'humidité dans la chambre d'enfant, combien d'électricité consommez-vous et pour quoi, y a-t-il une fuite d'eau quelque part.\n\nPour un plus grand confort des résidents, les ingénieurs de Pinout créeront un Internet sans faille à l'intérieur de l'appartement afin que vous n'ayez pas de zones mortes.\n\n## Espaces communs\n\nLe bâtiment ne serait pas considéré comme intelligent si la question se limitait uniquement à l'automatisation à l'intérieur de l'appartement. Dans les espaces communs, des relais intelligents surveilleront l'heure du lever et du coucher du soleil afin d'allumer l'éclairage extérieur lorsque cela est vraiment nécessaire, sans gaspiller de ressources. Les lumières dans le hall et les escaliers ne s'allumeront que lorsqu'un mouvement est détecté.\n\nEn ce qui concerne la sécurité, les résidents auront accès au système d'interphone depuis un seul panneau de contrôle domestique.

Des maisons et des appartements intelligents ont été construits depuis des décennies. Alors, que font de nouveau les ingénieurs de Pinout?\n\nVotre appartement est l'endroit le plus intime. Il est peu probable que vous soyez à l'aise en sachant que toutes vos données se retrouvent sur un serveur quelque part à l'extérieur de votre domicile. Dans ce projet, chaque appartement est équipé d'un serveur domestique avec Home Assistant. Ce logiciel vous permet de regrouper tous les appareils en un seul système et toutes les données resteront à l'intérieur de votre appartement.\n\nDe cette façon, nous nous débarrassons des retards dans la transmission des commandes via Internet. Si je suis chez moi et que j'appuie sur \"éteindre les lumières\", il est inutile d'envoyer un signal quelque part et d'attendre une réponse.\n\nDe plus, Home Assistant comprendra lui-même qu'un nouvel appareil intelligent est apparu, par exemple, une télévision ou un aspirateur robot, et proposera de l'ajouter. Vous pouvez vous-même étendre le système domotique et personnaliser l'automatisation selon vos habitudes.\n\nResidence 28 n'est pas seulement un nouveau complexe résidentiel avec automatisation.

I lavori inizieranno nel 2024.\n\n## Informazioni sul progetto\n\nLo sviluppatore CCS opera sul mercato dal 1997 e ha costruito più di 600 proprietà. Il progetto Residence 28 si trova a Limassol, Cipro. L'edificio sarà composto da due blocchi con una superficie abitabile totale (parte coperta) di circa 1800 m2.

Questo significa che il dispositivo richiede alimentazione costante, mentre i dispositivi nella colonna \"Senza fili\" sono alimentati a batteria.\n\nCosa porterà l'installazione di tutti questi dispositivi negli appartamenti?\n\nI pulsanti intelligenti consentiranno ai residenti di controllare l'illuminazione sia nel modo usuale che tramite un'applicazione per smartphone, impostare programmi e scenari. Ad esempio, mentre sei in camera da letto, puoi spegnere le luci in tutto l'appartamento o creare l'atmosfera per la serata con una scena definita.\n\nI telecomandi IR programmabili possono gestire più dispositivi da una sola posizione. Ad esempio, accendere l'aria condizionata secondo un programma o mantenere una temperatura impostata nella stanza.\n\nLe tende possono essere collegate alla tua sveglia per rendere il risveglio un'esperienza più piacevole.\n\nUn pulsante intelligente per la caldaia ti permetterà di impostare il programma una volta e non pensare più all'acqua calda in inverno.\n\nDiversi sensori ti forniranno informazioni complete sul luogo in cui vivi. Sono tutte le porte e finestre chiuse, qual è la temperatura e l'umidità nella stanza dei bambini, quanto elettricità consumi e per cosa, c'è una perdita d'acqua da qualche parte.\n\nPer un maggiore comfort per i residenti, gli ingegneri di Pinout creeranno una connessione Internet senza interruzioni all'interno dell'appartamento in modo che non ci siano zone morte.\n\n## Area comune\n\nL'edificio non sarebbe chiamato intelligente se la questione si limitasse solo all'automazione all'interno dell'appartamento. In un'area comune, i relè intelligenti monitoreranno l'ora del sorgere e del tramonto del sole per accendere l'illuminazione stradale quando è realmente necessario, senza sprechi di risorse. Le luci nella hall e nelle scale si accenderanno solo quando viene rilevato un movimento.\n\nPer quanto riguarda la sicurezza, i residenti avranno accesso al sistema di citofono da un unico pannello di controllo domestico. Installeremo anche telecamere CCTV per la sicurezza.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home lobby plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home lobby plan\" />\n\n## Conclusioneeee\n\nHai la sensazione che tutto questo sia già successo da qualche parte? Case e appartamenti intelligenti sono stati costruiti da decenni. Quindi cosa fanno di nuovo gli ingegneri di Pinout?\n\nIl tuo appartamento è il luogo più intimo. È improbabile che tu ti senta a tuo agio sapendo che tutti i tuoi dati finiscono su un server da qualche parte al di fuori della tua casa. In questo progetto, ogni appartamento è dotato di un server domestico con Home Assistant. Questo software ti permette di combinare tutti i dispositivi in un unico sistema e tutti i dati rimarranno all'interno del tuo appartamento.\n\nIn questo modo ci liberiamo dei ritardi nella trasmissione dei comandi su Internet. Se sono a casa e premo \"spegni le luci\", non ha senso inviare un segnale da qualche parte e aspettare una risposta.\n\nInoltre, Home Assistant stesso capirà che è apparato un nuovo dispositivo intelligente, ad esempio una TV o un aspirapolvere robot, e offrirà di aggiungerlo. Puoi espandere il sistema di casa intelligente e personalizzare l'automazione secondo le tue abitudini.\n\nResidence 28 non è solo un nuovo complesso residenziale con automazione.

Manaenkoです。私はPinout LTDの共同創設者であり、[Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/)プロジェクトの主要な開発者の一人です。今日は大きなニュースを皆さんと共有したいと思います：Pinout LTDは開発者[CCS](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/)と契約を結び、[Residence 28](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/property/residence-28)ビルの28のアパートと共用エリアの自動化を行います。作業は2024年に開始されます。\n\n## プロジェクトについて\n\n開発者のCCSは1997年以来市場で活動しており、600以上の物件を建設してきました。Residence 28プロジクトはキプロスのリマソールに位置しています。この建物は、合計約1800平方メートルの居住面積（屋根付き部分）を持つ2つのブロックで構成されます。これは、Zigbeeワイヤレスデバイスで制御されるスマートホームシステムを備えたキプロス初のアパートビルであり、オープンソースの[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)ソフトウェアによるリモートアクセスはRobonomics Parachain Web3クラウドを介して提供されます。\n\n## 将来の住民は何を受け取るのでしょうか？\n\n以下は2つのブロックの間取り図と指定の伝説です。\n\n<!-- ![Smart home floor plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home floor plan\" />\n\n「有線」という言葉に混乱しないでください。これはデバイスが常時電源を必要とすることを意味し、「ワイヤレス」の列のデバイスはバッテリーで動作します。\n\nこれらのデバイスの設置によってアパートにはどのような新しいものがもたらされるのでしょうか？\n\nスマートスイッチを使用すると、住民は通常の方法だけでなく、スマートフォンアプリを介して照明を制御したり、スケジュールやシナリオを設定したりすることができます。例えば、寝室にいる間にアパート全体の照明を消たり、特定のシーンで夜の雰囲気を作り出したりすることができます。\n\nプログラマブルな赤外線リモコンは、1つの場所から複数のデバイスを操作することができます。例えば、エアコンをスケジュールに従ってオンにしたり、部屋の設定温度を維持したりすることができます。\n\nカーテンは目覚まし時計に連動させることで、目覚めをより楽しいものにすることができます。\n\nスマートボイラーボタンを使用すると、スケジュールを設定するだけで、冬にお湯のことを考える必要がなくなります。\n\nさまざまなセンサーにより、住んでいる場所に関する完全な情報を得ることができます。すべてのドアと窓が閉まっているか、保育室の温度と湿度はどれくらいか、どれだけの電力を消費しているか、何のために消費しているか、どこかに水漏れはないかなどです。\n\n住民の快適さを高めるために、Pinoutのエンジニアはアパート内にシームレスなインターネットを作成します。そうすれば、デッドゾーンがなくなります。\n\n## 共用エリア\n\nアパート内の自動化に限定されているわけではないので、この建はスマートと呼ばれるわけです。共用エリアでは、スマートリレーが日の出と日の入りの時間を監視し、リソースを無駄にせずに必要な時に通り灯りを点灯させます。ロビーや階段の照明は、動きが検知された場合にのみ点灯します。\n\nセキュリティに関しては、住民は一つのホームコントロールパネルからインターコムシステムにアクセスすることができます。また、セキュリティのためにCCTVカメラも設置します。\n\n<!-- ![Smart home lobby plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home lobby plan\" />\n\n## 結論\n\nすでにどこかでこれらが起こったという感じはありませんか？スマートハウスやアパートは何十年も前から建設されています。では、Pinoutのエンジニアが新しいことをしているのは何でしょうか？\n\nあなたのアパートは最も親密な場所です。あなたのデータが自宅の外のどこかのサーバーに送られることを知って快適に感じることはないでしょう。このプロジェクトでは、各アパートにHome Assistantを搭載したホームサーバーが備えられています。このソフトウェアにより、すべてのデバイスを1つのシステムに統合することができ、すべてのデータはアパート内に残ります。\n\nこれにり、グローバルインターネットを介してコマンドを送信する遅延がなくなります。自宅にいて「照明を消す」と押しても、どこかに信号を送って応答を待つ意味はありません。\n\nさらに、Home Assistant自体が新しいスマートデバイス（例えば、テレビやロボット掃除機）が現れたことを認識し、追加するように提案してくれます。自分自身でスマートホームシステムを拡張し、習慣に合わせて自動化をカスタマイズすることができます。\n\nResidence 28は単なる自動化を備えた新しい住宅複合施設ではありません。これはあなたの生活に簡単に適応するスマートホームです。","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width:

[Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/) 프로젝트의 주요 개발자 중 한 명입니다. 오늘은 큰 소식을 여러분과 공유하고 싶습니다: Pinout LTD가 개발자 [CCS](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/)와 [Residence 28](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/property/residence-28) 건물의 28개 아파트와 공용 영역 자동화를 위한 계약을 체결했습니다. 작업은 2024년에 시작될 예정입니다.\n\n## 프로젝트 소개\n\nCCS 개발자는 1997년부터 시장에서 활동하고 있으며 600개 이상의 부동산을 건설했습니다. Residence 28 프로젝트는 키프로스 림소리에 위치해 있습니다. 이 건물은 총 생활 면적(실내 면적)이 약 1800m2인 두 개의 블록으로 구성될 것입니다. 이는 Zigbee 무선 장치로 구축된 스마트 홈 시스템이 탑재된 키프로스의 첫 아파트 건물이며, 이 시스템은 오픈 소스 [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) 소프트웨어로 제어되며 Robonomics Parachain Web3 클라우드를 통해 원격 액세스가 제공될 것입니다.\n\n## 미래 주민들은 무엇을 받게 될까요?\n\n아래는 두 개 블록 중 하나의 층별 계획과 표기 설명입니다.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home floor plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home floor plan\" />\n\n\"유선\"이라는 단어에 혼동되지 마세요. 이는 장치가 지속적인 전원을 필요로 한다는 것을 의미하며, \"무선\" 열에 있는 장치는 배터리로 작동됩니다.\n\n이 모든 장치를 설치하면 아파트에 어떤 새로운 변화가 있을까요?\n\n스마트 스위치를 사용하면 주민들은 일반적인 방식과 스마트폰 애플리케이션을 통해 조명을 제어하고 일정과 시나리오를 설정할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 침실에 있을 때 전체 아파트의 조명을 끄거나 정해진 장면으로 저녁 분위기를 조성할 수 있습니다.\n\n프로그래밍 가능한 IR 원격 제어는 한 곳에서 여러 장치를 제어할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 에어컨을 일정에 따라 켜거나 방의 온도를 설정하는 등의 기능을 수행할 수 있습니다.\n\n커튼은 알람 시계에 연동하여 깨어남을 더 즐거운 경험으로 만들 수 있습니다.\n\n스마트 보일러 버튼을 사용하면 한 번 일정을 설정하면 겨울에 따뜻한 물을 생각할 필요가 없습니다.\n\n다양한 센서를 통해 거주하는 장소에 대한 완전한 정보를 얻을 수 있습니다. 모든 문과 창문이 닫혔는지, 어린이 방의 온도와 습도는 어떤지, 전기를 얼마나 사용하고 어떤 용도로 사용하는지, 어딘가에 물이 샌 곳은 없는지 등을 알 수 있습니다.\n\n주민들의 편의를 위해 Pinout 엔지니어들은 아파트 내에서 무거운 인터넷을 제공할 것입니다. 이렇게 하면 죽은 지역이 없을 것입니다.\n\n## 공용 영역\n\n만약 아파트 내부 자동화로 제한된다면 이 건물은 스마트하다고 할 수 없을 것입니다. 공용 영역에서는 스마트 릴레이가 일출과 일몰 시간을 모니터링하여 에너지를 낭비하지 않고 필요한 때에만 가로등을 켤 것입니다. 로비와 계단에 있는 조명은 움직임이 감지될 때에만 켜집니다.\n\n보안에 관해서는 주민들은 단일 홈 컨트롤 패널에서 인터콤 시스템에 액세스 수 있습니다. 또한 보안을 위해 CCTV 카메라를 설치할 것입니다.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home lobby plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home lobby plan\" />\n\n## 결론\n\n이미 어딘가에서 이 모든 것이 일어난 것 같은 느낌이 드시나요? 스마트 하우스와 아파트는 수십 년 동안 건설되어 왔습니다. 그렇다면 Pinout 엔지니어들이 새롭게 하는 일은 무엇일까요?\n\n당신의 아파트는 가장 친밀한 장소입니다. 당신의 모든 데이터가 집 밖의 서버 어딘가에 저장된다는 것을 알고 있다면 편안하지 않을 것입니다. 이 프로젝트에서는 각 아파트마다 Home Assistant가 탑재된 홈 서버가 설치됩니다. 이 소프트웨어를 사용하면 모든 장치를 하나의 시스템으로 통합할 수 있으며, 모든 데이터는 아파트 내부에 유지됩니다.\n\n이렇게 하면 글로벌 인터넷을 통해 명령을 전송하는 데에 딜레이가 없어집니다. 집에 있고 \"조명 끄기\"를 누르면 어딘가에 신호를 보내고 응답을 기다릴 필요가 없습니다.\n\n또한 Home Assistant 자체가 새로운 스마트 장치가 나타났음을 인식하고, 예를 들어 TV나 로봇 청소기와 같은 장치를 추가할 것을 제안할 것입니다. 스마트 홈 시스템을 확장하고 습관에 맞게 자동화를 사용자 정의할 수 있습니다.\n\nResidence 28은 자동화된 새로운 주거 단지에 불과하지 않습니다. 이는 당신의 삶에 쉽게 적응하는 스마트 홈입니다.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-8fed60bbd211c9371711ca43f66155a4'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-8fed60bbd211c9371711ca43f66155a4)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwUEBgABAgj/xAAsEAABAgUDAgYBBQAAAAAAAAABAgMABAURMRIhQRRRBiIyYXGBExVSkbHw/8QAGAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAAP/xAAcEQEBAQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABABECMQMSISL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/APSIBOIzSe0YMi%2bI71N33TaLGiIcbAJJCQSbE2GT7RDrLMxNU59mQe6eYWgpS5%2b0nmAUuUnZemS7E1NJefbTpWtSSrV2zvsOeYCsTO5moWJBjUJa7IVWcYZTTakiTWgqKyG/Vt5e%2bDvbmHkqCloBxYU4EgFWLm25A4ja2wbEpKgSOI5gkwpIKbqTjexgQUDg3gjsEyHvY%2bYfcKa8xPPdD0E2JcdShLubrSQRbY9/n4iSp9atQODf6iC5MPuTjbCFNpbbeY9SCSSSr3G22ITy/OM/jP1S6PWPz09l55twE/l2WkAq0JvuTj6v72gIqb6a9ISLrerqpZUyFoWNKQOCM/wT8xVGqx%2biSVPlOnS8VKmgFpIbA8nYCJPhqsu1qsS0440hpTMiptABJ8utPJ5/1o48N9i7c89ZtOTVRptVnHnXy/KKeaS0yhJugLSfUe1xfHsLw/XNqdfTLMABxcwtq6wE20pCrC1yc5tfuIqNTW/PyKJh9TN9cq6QGr8K2FybZzC8%2bNJiWnVWlGlPIqDqdWshJuAPT8Ac53hVXqYDK0%2bG6kqpSD0y%2b0pCkPrZ9erVpNrj2hwSODsMxVvCilCkoAI0rU45a3JdVf8AqHZWo3BOcxXxPlM93//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"ko"}},{"node":{"title":"Edifício de apartamentos com Home Assistant a bordo","path":"/blog/pt/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/","date":"December 8, 2023","description":"O seu apartamento é o lugar mais íntimo.

Sou co-fundador da Pinout LTD e um dos principais desenvolvedores do projeto [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/). Hoje quero compartilhar com vocês uma grande notícia: a Pinout LTD assinou um contrato com o desenvolvedor [CCS](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/) para a automação de 28 apartamentos e áreas comuns no edifício [Residence 28](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/property/residence-28). O trabalho começará em 2024.\n\n## Sobre o Projeto\n\nA CCS está operando no mercado desde 1997 e construiu mais de 600 propriedades. O projeto Residence 28 está localizado em Limassol, Chipre. O edifício será composto por dois blocos com uma área habitável total (parte coberta) de cerca de 1800 m2. Este será o primeiro edifício de apartamentos em Chipre com um sistema residencial inteligente construído em dispositivos sem fio Zigbee controlados pelo software de código aberto [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), o acesso remoto será fornecido através da nuvem Robonomics Parachain Web3.\n\n## O que os futuros moradores receberão?\n\nAbaixo está o plano de um dos dois blocos e uma legenda de designação.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home floor plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home floor plan\" />\n\nNão se confunda com a palavra \"Com fio\". Isso significa que o dispositivo requer energia constante, enquanto os dispositivos na coluna \"Sem fio\" são alimentados por bateria.\n\nO que a instalação de todos esses dispositivos trará de novo para os apartamentos?\n\nInterruptores inteligentes permitirão que os moradores controlem a iluminação tanto da maneira usual quanto através de um aplicativo de smartphone, configurem horários e cenários. Por exemplo, enquanto estiver no quarto, você pode desligar as luzes em todo o apartamento ou criar a atmosfera para a noite com uma cena definida.\n\nControles remotos IR programáveis podem controlar vários dispositivos de um único local. Por exemplo, ligar o ar condicionado em um horário programado ou manter uma temperatura definida no ambiente.\n\nAs cortinas podem ser vinculadas ao seu despertador para tornar a experiência de acordar mais agradável.\n\nUm botão inteligente para o aquecedor permitirá que você defina o cronograma uma vez e não precise mais se preocupar com água quente no inverno.\n\nVários sensores fornecerão informações completas sobre o local onde você mora. Todas as suas portas e janelas estão fechadas, qual é a temperatura e umidade no quarto das crianças, quanto de eletricidade você consome e para quê, há algum vazamento de água em algum lugar.\n\nPara maior conforto dos moradores, os engenheiros da Pinout criarão uma Internet perfeita dentro do apartamento para que você não tenha áreas sem sinal.\n\n## Área Comum\n\nO edifício não seria chamado de inteligente se a questão se limitasse apenas à automação dentro do apartamento. Em uma área comum, relés inteligentes monitorarão o horário do nascer e do pôr do sol para ligar a iluminação externa apenas quando realmente necessário, sem desperdiçar recursos. As luzes no saguão e nas escadas só acenderão quando houver movimento.\n\nEm relação à segurança, os moradores terão acesso ao sistema de intercomunicação a partir de um único painel de controle residencial. Também instalaremos câmeras de segurança.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home lobby plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home lobby plan\" />\n\n## Conclusão\n\nVocê tem a sensação de que tudo isso já aconteceu em algum lugar? Casas e apartamentos inteligentes têm sido construídos há décadas. Então, o que os engenheiros da Pinout estão fazendo de novo?\n\nO seu apartamento é o lugar mais íntimo. É improvável que você se sinta confortável sabendo que todos os seus dados acabam em um servidor em algum lugar fora de sua casa. Neste projeto, cada apartamento está equipado com um servidor doméstico com o Home Assistant. Este software permite combinar todos os dispositivos em um único sistema, e todos os dados permanecerão dentro do seu apartamento.\n\nDessa forma, nos livramos dos atrasos na transmissão de comandos pela Internet global. Se estou em casa e pressiono \"desligar as luzes\", não faz sentido enviar um sinal para algum lugar e esperar por uma resposta.\n\nAlém disso, o Home Assistant em si entenderá que um novo dispositivo inteligente apareceu, por exemplo, uma TV ou um aspirador de pó robô, e oferecerá para adicioná-lo. Você mesmo pode expandir o sistema residencial inteligente e personalizar a automação de acordo com seus hábitos.\n\nO Residence 28 não é apenas um novo complexo residencial com automação. Esta é uma casa inteligente que se adapta facilmente à sua vida.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-8fed60bbd211c9371711ca43f66155a4'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='15'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-8fed60bbd211c9371711ca43f66155a4)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwUEBgABAgj/xAAsEAABAgUDAgYBBQAAAAAAAAABAgMABAURMRIhQRRRBiIyYXGBExVSkbHw/8QAGAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAAP/xAAcEQEBAQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABABECMQMSISL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/APSIBOIzSe0YMi%2bI71N33TaLGiIcbAJJCQSbE2GT7RDrLMxNU59mQe6eYWgpS5%2b0nmAUuUnZemS7E1NJefbTpWtSSrV2zvsOeYCsTO5moWJBjUJa7IVWcYZTTakiTWgqKyG/Vt5e%2bDvbmHkqCloBxYU4EgFWLm25A4ja2wbEpKgSOI5gkwpIKbqTjexgQUDg3gjsEyHvY%2bYfcKa8xPPdD0E2JcdShLubrSQRbY9/n4iSp9atQODf6iC5MPuTjbCFNpbbeY9SCSSSr3G22ITy/OM/jP1S6PWPz09l55twE/l2WkAq0JvuTj6v72gIqb6a9ISLrerqpZUyFoWNKQOCM/wT8xVGqx%2biSVPlOnS8VKmgFpIbA8nYCJPhqsu1qsS0440hpTMiptABJ8utPJ5/1o48N9i7c89ZtOTVRptVnHnXy/KKeaS0yhJugLSfUe1xfHsLw/XNqdfTLMABxcwtq6wE20pCrC1yc5tfuIqNTW/PyKJh9TN9cq6QGr8K2FybZzC8%2bNJiWnVWlGlPIqDqdWshJuAPT8Ac53hVXqYDK0%2bG6kqpSD0y%2b0pCkPrZ9erVpNrj2hwSODsMxVvCilCkoAI0rU45a3JdVf8AqHZWo3BOcxXxPlM93//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"pt"}},{"node":{"title":"Багатоквартирний будинок з Home Assistant на борту","path":"/blog/uk/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/","date":"December 8, 2023","description":"Ваша квартира - найінтимніше місце.

Я співзасновник компанії Pinout LTD та один з ключових розробників проекту [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/). Сьогодні я хочу поділитися з вами великими новинами: Pinout LTD підписала контракт з розробником [CCS](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/) на автоматизацію 28 квартир та загальних приміщень у будинку [Residence 28](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/property/residence-28). Роботи озпочнуться у 2024 році.\n\n## Про проект\n\nРозробник CCS працює на ринку з 1997 року і побудував понад 600 об'єктів. Проект Residence 28 розташований у Лімасолі, Кіпр. Будівля складатиметься з двох блоків загальною житловою площею (закрита частина) близько 1800 м2. Це буде перший багатоквартирний будинок на Кіпрі з системою розумного будинку, побудованою на бездротових пристроях Zigbee, керованих відкритим програмним забезпеченням [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), дистанційний доступ буде забезпечено через хмару Robonomics Parachain Web3.\n\n## Що отримають майбутні мешканці?\n\nНижче наведено план поверху одного з двох блоків та легенду позначень.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home floor plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home floor plan\" />\n\nНе плутайтеся словом \"Проводовий\". Це означає, що пристрій потребує постійного живлення, тоді як пристрої в стовпчику \"Бездротовий\" працюють від батарейок.\n\nЯкі нововведення принесе встановлення всіх цих пристроїв в квартири?\n\nРозумні вимикачі дозволять мешканцям керувати освітленням як звичайним способом, так і за допомогою смартфону, налаштовувати розклади та сценарії. Наприклад, будучи в спальні, ви можете вимкнути світло в усій квартирі або створити атмосферу для вечора за заданим сценарієм.\n\nПрограмовані пультів дистанційного керування ІЧ можуть керувати кількома пристроями з одного місця. Наприклад, включення кондиціонера за розкладом або підтримка заданої температури в кімнаті.\n\nШтори можна прив'язати до будильника, щоб зробити пробудження більш приємним враженням.\n\nКнопка розумного котла дозволить вам налаштувати графік один раз і більше не думати про гарячу воду взимку.\n\nРізні датчики нададуть вам повну інформацію про місце, де ви живете. Чи закриті всі ваші двері та вікна, яка температура та вологість у дитячій кімнаті, скільки електроенергії ви споживаєте і на що, чи є десь витік води.\n\nДля більшого комфорту мешканців інженери Pinout створять безшовний Інтернет у квартирі, щоб у вас не було мертвих зон.\n\n## Загальна зона\n\nБудівлю не можна назвати розумною, якщо справа обмежується лише автоматизацією всередині квартири. У загальній зоні розумні реле будуть контролювати час сходу і заходу сонця, щоб вмикати вуличне освітлення, коли це дійсно потрібно, без марнування ресурсів. Світло в фойє та сходових клітках буде вмикатися лише при виявленні руху.\n\nЩодо безпеки, мешканці матимуть доступ до домофонної системи зі єдиного панелі керування вдома. Ми також встановимо відеокамери для забезпечення безпеки.\n\n<!-- ![Smart home lobby plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home lobby plan\" />\n\n## Висновок\n\nЧи ви маєте відчуття, що все це вже сталося десь? Розумні будинки та квартири будуються десятиліттями. То що нового роблять інженери Pinout?\n\nВаша квартира - найінтимніше місце. Малоймовірно, що вам буде зручно знати, що всі ваші дані потрапляють на сервер десь поза вашим будинком. У цьому проекті кожна квартира обладнана домашнім сервером з Home Assistant. Це програмне забезпечення дозволяє об'єднати всі пристрої в одну систему, і всі дані залишаться всередині вашої квартири.\n\nТаким чином ми позбавляємося затримок у передачі команд через глобальний Інтернет. Якщо я вдома і натискаю «вимкнути світло», немає сенсу відправляти сигнал кудись і чекати відповіді.\n\nКрім того, Home Assistant сам розумітиме, що з'явився новий розумний пристрій, наприклад, телевізор або робот-пилосос, і запропонує його додати. Ви самі можете розширити систему розумного будинку та налаштувати автоматизацію під свої звички.\n\nResidence 28 - це не просто новий житловий комплекс з автоматизацією. Це розумний будинок, який легко адаптується до вашого життя.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px)

2023","description":"您的公寓是最亲密的地方。您可能不会舒服地知道您的所有数据都会存储在家外的某个服务器上。在这个项目中，每个公寓都配备了一个带有Home Assistant的家庭服务器。","content":"\n大家好！\n\n我的名字是Vadim Manaenko。我是Pinout LTD的联合创始人，也是[Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/)项目的主要开发人员之一。今天我想与大家分享一个重大消息：Pinout LTD已与开发商[CCS](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/)签订了一份合同，用于自动化[Residence 28](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/property/residence-28)楼内的28个公寓和公共区域。工作将于2024年开始。\n\n## 关于项目\n\n开发商CCS自1997年以来一直在市场上运营，并建造了600多个物业。Residence 28项目位于塞浦路斯利马索尔。该建筑将由两个楼块组成，总建筑面积（覆盖部分）约为1800平方米。这将是塞浦路斯第一座采用由开源软件[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)控制的Zigbee无线设备构建的智能家居系统的公寓楼，远程问将通过Robonomics Parachain Web3云提供。\n\n## 未来的居民将获得什么？\n\n下面是两个楼块之一的楼层平面图和指示图例。\n\n<!-- ![Smart home floor plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-floor-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home floor plan\" />\n\n不要被“有线”一词所困惑。这意味着设备需要持续供电，而“无线”列中的设备是电池供电的。\n\n安装所有这些设备会给公寓带来什么新的东西？\n\n智能开关将允许居民通过智能手机应用程序控制照明，设置时间表和场景。例如，在卧室中，您可以关闭整个公寓的灯光或创建定义的场景来营造夜晚的氛围。\n\n可编程的红外遥控器可以从一个位置控制多个设备。例如，按计划打开空调或保持房间的设定温度。\n\n窗帘可以与您的闹钟绑定，使您的起床体验更加愉快。\n\n智能锅炉按钮将允许您设置一次时间表，不再考虑冬天的热水问题。\n\n各种传感器将为您提供有关您居住地的完整信息。您的所有门窗是否关闭，托儿所的温度和湿度如何，您消耗了多少电力以及用于什么，是否有水泄漏等。\n\n为了给居民提供更大的舒适度，Pinout工程师将在公寓内创建无缝的互联网，以便您没有死角。\n\n## 公共区域\n\n如果仅限于公寓内的自动化，该建筑将无法称为智能。在公共区域，智能继电器将监控日出和日时间，以便在真正需要时打开街道照明，而不浪费资源。大堂和楼梯间的灯光只有在检测到运动时才会打开。\n\n关于安全性，居民将可以从单一的家庭控制面板访问对讲系统。我们还将安装闭路电视摄像头进行安全监控。\n\n<!-- ![Smart home lobby plan](../images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg) -->\n\n<rb-image zoom src=\"./images/cyprus-residence-with-home-assistant/smart-home-lobby-plan-cyprus-residence.jpg\" alt=\"Smart home lobby plan\" />\n\n## 结论\n\n您是否有一种这一切已经在某个地方发生过的感觉？智能房屋和公寓已经建造了几十年。那么Pinout工程师在做什么新的事情呢？\n\n您的公寓是最亲密的地方。您可能不会舒服地知道您的所有数据都会存储在家外的某个服务器上。在这个项目中，每个公寓都配备了一个带有Home Assistant的家庭服务器。这个软件可以将所有设备组合成一个系统，所有数据都将保留在您的公寓内。\n\n这样，我们就摆脱了通过全球互联网传输命令的延迟。如果我在家里按下“关闭灯光”按钮，发送信号并等待响应就没有意义了。\n\n此外，Home Assistant本身将了解到新的智能设备的出现，例如电视或机器人吸尘器，并提供添加的选项。您自己可以扩展智能家居系统并根据自己的习惯进行自定义自动化。\n\nResidence 28不仅是一个带有自动化的新住宅综合体。这是一个可以轻松适应您生活的智能家居。","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.353ad8b8ff7badc2ecd1e532496e9229.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width:

In this article, we'll take a look at the series of events that led to the restart of the campaign and present its new parameters.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Kusama OpenGov Causes cₕₐₒₛ\n\nThe long awaited arrival of the new governance system, OpenGov (Gov2), has finally arrived on Kusama, but it brought along a lot of chaos with it. The instatement of the new OpenGov system resulted in the previously scheduled auctions not being successfully enacted. The Kusama community had started [Gov1 referendum #252](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/252) for fixing the auctions schedule, but it did not enact successfully because of restrictions of AuctionAdmin privilege. This error was caused by the fact that in the new gov system it is mandatory to push the OpenGov proposal on the Auction track in order to launch auctions. It was decided to adjust OpenGov params with [a runtime upgrade](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/254), but this referendum was also not successful either due to a conflict between the Gov1 and Gov2 logic.\n\nAll in all, it took the Kusama community and developers a couple of weeks to figure out the intricacies of the new governance system. This was unforeseen, and had impacted the Robonomics project’s plans to bid in an parachain slot auction in our November 2022 crowdloan campaign. We have already dissolved [the November 2022 crowdloan](/blog/robonomics-crowdloan-campaigns-november-2022/) which was initiated on paraID 2237, and all KSM has been returned to the crowdloan contributors.\n\n## New Challenges for Extending the Lease of the Slot\n\n**The standard method** for swapping parachain leases prior to the release of OpenGov was the following:\n\n1. Generate new paraID using registrar(Reserve) extrinsic.\n2. Set on-chain ID for new paraID.\n3. Open crowdloan using crowdloan(Create) extrinsic.\n4. Bid in a parachain slot auction.\n5. If successful in the auction, then the developers would initiate governance action to swap over the lease from this donor paraID to the working parachain paraID using the forceLease and registrar:swap functions, similar to these previous referendums: [Karura lease swap](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/192), [Moonriver and Khala lease swap](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/468), [Shiden lease swap](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/199), [Parallel-Heiko lease swap](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/219), [Genshiro lease swap](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/246).\n6. The end result would be that the working parachain would have its lease extended, continue to produce blocks, and not suffer any downtime.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of OpenGov, thresholds for governance action on Kusama have become extraordinarily high. In basic terms, the new OpenGov system has multiple tracks. Each track can support a specific type of function (can call only particular extrinsics). Some tracks have limited power, such as tipping small amounts of KSM, but others have tremendous power, such as the Root track.\n\nThe thresholds for OpenGov tracks are extraordinarily high, and there are already actions within the Kusama community to lower them, as they are already causing issues for parachain projects such as [Kintsugi](https://twitter.com/kintsugi_btc/status/1599036329399943168). Simply put, a particular referendum must obtain enough support from the network's stakeholders (KSM holders) in order for the referendum to pass from the voting period to the confirmation period. \n\nIn order for the parachain to be able to carry out the aforementioned 6 step plan to swap the lease, it is needed to start the parachain auction schedule once again, this means that an OpenGov referendum should pass that restarts the auctions either via the Lease Admin track, or possibly as part of a runtime upgrade via the Root/Whitelisted Caller tracks. This is where the issue arises – in order for the referendum to be put into the confirmation period in a timely manner, it requires a significant percentage of all circulating supply of KSM tokens to vote in favour of the referendum. Typical voter turnout on Kusama is relatively low, meaning that it could potentially take multiple weeks for a Lease Admin track referendum to reach a threshold where it is realistically possible for the referendum to be pushed through to the confirmation period.\n\nWhile we still hope that the community will adjust OpenGov params, fortunately, there is a way that the parachain can use XCM in order to execute the 6 step plan without needing to utilise the relay chain’s new OpenGov system.\n\nWe can register a new paraID using the registrar(Reserve) extrinsic, and load a shell runtime to that paraID using the registrar(Register) extrinsic. This parachain should only initiate XCM messages for lease swaps. We then send an XCM message containing a lease swap request from the main parachain to the shell parachain. When the shell parachain wins an auction, and the lease becomes active, a minimal environment is launched which is able to send an XCM message to swap the lease slot with the main parachain.\n\n## New Parameters for Crowdloan Campaign\n\nAs [mentioned previously](https://robonomics.network/blog/robonomics-crowdloan-campaigns-november-2022/), we want to automate our crowdloan campaigns based on the statistics on the cost of slot leasing and ideal staking rate. Let’s take a look at current parameters for the renewal algorithm.\n\n<Card alignContent=\"center\">\n\n**1.
