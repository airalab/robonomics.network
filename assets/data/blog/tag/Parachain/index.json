We discussed further development roadmap, and answered the most frequent questions from the community members.","content":"\nYakub - Hi everyone!\nLet me introduce myself. My name is Yakub; I’m Growth & Marketing manager at Robonomics.network.\nToday we’ll be talking about the development roadmap of Robonomics.Network.\n\nSergei Lonshakov, one of the brightest minds of the CIS crypto community, will provide us with updates regarding the further development plan of Robonomics.network.\nSergei, before we start, would you mind to tell the community a bit about your background and traction of Robonomics.network and what is your exact role in the project?\n\n\nSergei- Hi folks! This is Sergei software architect at Robonomics.Network.\nI was involved in Robonomics concepts from the beginning of the project in 2015, and I invented part of the ideas behind the Robonomics project.\nSo, Robonomics for me is a personal story and long road from ideas to implementation, and I hope in the near future to the global ecosystem with many smart cities/industry 4.0 projects inside.\n\nMost interesting about my work, you can find in the form of articles on [Google.Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0c53yygAAAAJ&hl=en) and on [Medium](https://blog.aira.life/@ensrationis).\n\nBest way to reach me in social networks is [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EnsRationis)\n\nBefore 2015:\n2007- 2009- QA engineer and Data Modeler at international outsourcing company Epam Systems.\n2009–2012- My first outsource development company in Russia for development e-commerce projects.\n2012–2015- With part of the existing team of Robonomics, we worked as developers with Bitcoin projects like mining pools, web wallets and so on.\n\nYakub - Great, I guess most of the community members already know you, but for the newcomers, there’re a lot of things to research.\nHow do you personally contribute to the development of Robonomics.network?\n\nSergei - In Robonomics I closely work with:\n> @akru_me to design substrate implementation of [Robonomics network](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics) and our [Aira OS](https://github.com/airalab/aira) for the robotics industry.\n> @vol4tim to develop [Robonomics dapp library for js devs](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-js).\n> @kap2fox to publish new [scientific articles](https://robonomics.network/community#science) entitled to the economy of robots.\n> @vourhey to prepare [Robotics + Blockchain R&D projects](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/r-and-d-based-on-robonomics-network/).\n\nYakub- I think it would be great to share the background of Alexander Kapitonov(@Kap2Fox) with the community. As far as I know, you’re almost lifetime fellows! How did this friendship arise?\n\nSergei- We are friends for more than 10 years starting from studentship. He introduced me to @akru_me @vourhey and many other people who worked and continue to work with Robonomics concepts.\nToday he is a big man in the academic world.\n\nHe’s [Dean of the Faculty of Infocommunication Technologies at ITMO](https://en.itmo.ru/en/viewperson/1564/Alexander_Kapitonov.htm) in St Petersburg.\nHe also continues to work with Robonomics Network as a researcher, and help to involve students and professors to Robonomics vision, based on a scientific approach.\nFor example, [Fabio Bonsignorio](https://blog.aira.life/novel-ways-to-develop-robotics-and-ai-infrastructures-by-seamlessly-merging-new-financial-and-new-c43060de4fa) good fellow of Robonomics started to work with us after Alexander reached him in Academic fields.\n\nYakub- Lets dive into the development updates you wanted to share with the community.\n\nSergei- Robonomcis Developer diaries December 2020:\n(1) [Robonomics ready for Rococo Relay Chain’s relaunch](https://twitter.com/EnsRationis/status/1334407718384365568).\nThis is going to be the last stop before Kusama Relay Chain is ready to connect parachains.\nI don’t know how long we should wait until Rococo v1 release, and when we can expect the Kusama Slot auction. But from the tech side, as I see Rococo v1 still has some opened issues on the Github that need to be resolved, and I guess in the next several weeks it will be done.\nNo one knows, how long it will take to implement Rococo v1 features into Kusama. Maybe weeks. maybe months — let’s see and help parity developers on this way.\n\n(2) [Robonomics Web Services will be ready for the first testers soon](https://robonomics.cloud/).\nCore dev team decided to launch the fork of Polkadot Relay chain with latest Rococo v1 updates and registered there Robonomics Parachain.\nStay tuned in Twitter, and you will be one of the first who will touch Robonomics Web Services.\n\nYakub- Wow, it means that Robonomics development team helps core Polkadot developers to test out the Relay chain, fascinating!\n\nSergei- For sure! We’re like a second testbed for Bastian (main contributor of Cumulus) today I think.\n\n(3) We finished the XRT staking architecture, and it’s going to be something new for the crypto blockchain industry.\nTo understand why our staking mechanism is not the same as regular NPoS in Polkadot, we need to dive into its theory.\nStaking mechanism in the parachains has to differ from the Relay chain’s architecture because parachains doesn’t have to maintain its security.\nAnd that is the goal for researchers and architects!\nSo, our team invented a unique stacking mechanism to achieve Robonomics Web Service’s monthly subscription payments. Beneficiaries of those payments would be XRT stakers. We’ll publish more details in our [blog](https://robonomics.network/blog/) soon.\n\n(4) [Robonomics Sensors Connectivity v0.5 released](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1335955941653704706) \n\nSupported humidity, temperature, pollution, GPS sensors. We merged open data-stuttgart firmware by [Luftdaten](http://luftdaten.info). [Try to connect a sensor to Robonomics network right now](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/connect-sensor-to-robonomics/).\n\nYakub- It was pretty exciting!\nAlso, you wanted to share further development roadmap for the next 6 months\n\nSergei- Sure, but that’s not for the AMA session let’s try to make it short and explain it in details in our blog later.\nNext 6-months we will spend with:\n(1) RWS open tests and benchmarking.\n\n(2) First R&D interchain communication project to launch IoT devices via transaction from other parachain on Rococo v1.\n\n(3) Kusama Parachain slot auction rehearsal.\n\n(4) Ethereum Exodus event and first small bags public auctions of XRT.\n\n(5) First marketplace of services to hire robotics hourly for developers in San Francisco.\n\n(6) DAO IPCI smart building offsetting services with real carbon credits integration with Robonomics Parachain.\n\n(7) Launch the first version of the Distributed Sky project, register mechanism for drones.\n\nYakub- A lot of things to digest for everyone! Lets head to the last month’s most frequent questions from the community.\nPretty sure that everyone will be waiting for the article!\n\n1, One of the most popular questions from the community members is —\n“When is the kusama parachain auction? And how do we support Robonomics.network increasing the likehood of success?”\n\nI'll answer it by myself:\n\nIt’s important to notice, that there are no Kusama parachains yet.\nPolkadot’s community is waiting for the first parachain slots auction.\n[Robonomics joined 1st Rococo’s parachains party](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1296834125073125379) back in 21.08.2020.\nIn that regard, here is how it was possible to connect to Robonomics parachain on Rococo v0.\n[Rococo](https://polkadot.network/introducing-rococo-polkadots-parachain-testnet/) is a Substrate based testnet of Polkadot & Kusama.\n\nCurrently, we’re [ready for Rococo v1](https://twitter.com/EnsRationis/status/1334407718384365568) update, that will bring cross-chain communication for parachains.\nRobonomics team shared the [vision of obtaining Kusama parachain slot here](https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-b0a6daf50c22?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------).\n\nLong story short — none of the projects confirmed as first parachains on Kusama.\n\n2, “Сan somebody explain to me what is the relationship between Robonomics and IPCI? and also why do you have a different chain for IPCI ? I couldn’t find any info around this on robonomics site?”\n\nSergei- DAO IPCI is a Robonomics dev team’s partner since 2016. \n[Here you can find traction of DAO IPCI development](https://ipci.io/2020-strategy-announcement-project-overview/).\n\nA year ago we announced [Blockchain for Open Sensors Network Initiative at COP25](https://evercity.medium.com/blockchain-for-open-sensors-network-initiative-announced-at-at-cop25-3ca15c5a0d32) and that was the starting point for launching an independent substrate chain on Robonomics implementation.\n\nThe decision to make DAO IPCI a separate project is a long term strategy. When we are ready to connect Robonomics as a Relay Chain to Polkadot — DAO IPCI will be one of the first parachains inside Robonomics ecosystem as an IoT network of pollution measurement sensors for monitoring verification and reporting system connected to the [public blockchain](https://twitter.com/EnsRationis/status/1337302002401947648).\n\nYakub- 3, What is the destiny of 7 million locked XRT?\n\nSergei- It will be locked before eth 2.0 phase 2 (my prediction, not earlier than Q2 — Q3 2022).\n\nMentioned XRT budget will be released only on auctions (there are no free tokens in that 7 mln), and only when Robonomics Network will unite its tokenomics on top of Ethereum and Polkadot.\n\nI find it as one of the most encouraging parts of all development processes of Robonomics as a platform, because it will allow developers to make a transaction with the same token on Ethereum or Polkadot networks depending on the choice.\n\n> One platform for robotics engineers with different blockchains under the hood — that is the mission of the core DAO development team in the long term.\n\nYakub- 4, When will we be able to stake XRT? What’s required to do that? What will we get for staking XRT?\n\nSergei- I already told you what I wanted to share on this AMA session.\nGive me some time to polish the staking article, it’s quite complicated to reveal the unique staking mechanics in a few messages in Telegram.\n\nYakub- Sure, take your time, we will be waiting for it.\nWe’ve almost finished this AMA session!\n\nLets jump to the top 5 questions from the community members.\n\nQuestion from Gordylad:\nWithin Scotland, UK we have a blueprint in relation to strategy towards Smart Cities.\nThe four high level goals are centred around Citizens/Communities, Business/Economy, Environment, Performance/Operation.\n\nQ — How can Robonomics play a role in helping cities create opportunities within the space of Technology and Innovation?\nTaking into consideration the approach to sustainability, climate change and importantly changing the mindset of people to open up and to try and understand the benefits of your role in a blockchain transactional environment.\n\n    Sergei- A big part of our work is the vision of sustainable smart cities as described by the UN. Have a look at articles like that:\n    Sustainable and smart cities for all ages.\n    Context The [UNECE region](www.unece.org) is among the most highly urbanized in the world - with the rising share of the population…\n\nAnd our scientific papers like this:\n\n>[Trustable Environmental Monitoring by Means of Sensors Networks on Swarming Autonomous Marine](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2020.00070/full) - The article describes a highly trustable environmental monitoring system employing a small scalable swarm of drones.\n\nSo, I think 50% of our research is the vision of developing sustainable smart cities concepts of IoT applications — try to deep dive into our research, ask our engineers (for example Vadim @vourhey ) and build cool stuff for UK with Robonomics open-source platform.\n\nYakub- Question from SonOfTheSun\n\nWhat sort of corporations, or rather, industries does Robonomics expect $RWS to play a role in? In other words, who would be the potential consumers of $RWS?\n\nYakub- I guess SonOfTheSun meant $RWS as Robonomics Web Services.\n\nSergei- The same who use today [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/) or [Microsoft Azure IoT](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/iot/).\n\nHave a look at AWS and Azure websites to find who are the users of IoT services of these companies today, the same end-users / companies will be RWS customers in the future. Additionally, RWS will make more for companies IoT infrastructure, because Robonomics Web Services is truly global and can be a platform for companies who are now outside the customer services of Amazon.\n\nYakub- Question from zamirakimov.\n\nWill it be possible on Robonomics platform to make robo-taxi infrastructure fully paid by XRT, including XRT payment bot, allowing payments not only for using robo-taxis but also for creating crowd co-owning service for robo-taxis fleet and even further for investing in robotic manufacturing of new robo-cabs to satisfy market requirements?\n\nSergei- For sure why not :) Start here:\n\n> [Drone control with robonomics.](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/iris-drone/) Drone activates after the succesful transcation and store its log with the coordinates in IPFS.\n\nYakub- Question from bijikgelantungan.\n\nAs an open source package for 4.0 developers, why should developers make Robonomics platform as their go-to platform? How do you support them? Do you have a developers’ training program like DevCamp or developer’s reward program?\n\nSergei- If you develop on Robonomics you have the support of hundreds of robotics from the box.\nHave a look at robotics which can be used under Robonomics control for your IoT application right now:\nrobots.ros.org\nAn index of ROS Robots\n\n> ** DevCamps was for Russian developers in Summer 2017, 2018 and we will continue online for English speaking developers this winter. **\n\nYakub- Amazing!!!!\n\nAnd the last one for today — question from Ilyaboev.\n\nWhen will robots become autonomous economic agents?\n\nSergei- Right now, in front of you. Before the end of this year, our engineers will launch the X-Mas Gaka-Chu paintings auction which was presented first time here:\nSo you will be able to buy artwork directly from robot-artist.\n\nYakub- Sergei, thank you for the AMA! It's quite informative!","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/up_for_grabs_1.62c183a.a0a5b063df9ecdd69536d9c499d0b02a.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":838},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/up_for_grabs_1.9ea8d39.a0a5b063df9ecdd69536d9c499d0b02a.jpg 480w","/assets/static/up_for_grabs_1.6b2ed88.a0a5b063df9ecdd69536d9c499d0b02a.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/up_for_grabs_1.62c183a.a0a5b063df9ecdd69536d9c499d0b02a.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 838' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-49ebd7ecd7ecb2c8c8cc5e2b00b3a759'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-49ebd7ecd7ecb2c8c8cc5e2b00b3a759)' width='1500' height='838' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAkAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAQUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgADBAUHCP/EADEQAAEDAwMBBgQGAwAAAAAAAAECAwQABRESITEGBxNBUWFxFCIjgRUyQpGh8DVDsf/EABkBAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECBAMFAP/EACgRAAICAQIEBQUAAAAAAAAAAAECABEDEkEEITHRExQiMlFhgbHB8P/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A50jsvvjLDLrgzjKEFW%2b223uP3p5ESU5qCIz6tONWGztkZGftv7VcdHQOpJlpU9YpiWmO/W33YXhRWG9RxsdyAAPM%2b1WrnT/WTU6MwZTK37k8mIj6gPeKCFaQSU7DAUn7b4GDVa5E3k7eYs6Qtbcz2giu3zc4%2bDk53/1K8OfCoT6FsuFDqFtrHKVAg/saM73E6otFu%2bNm3RhLZbbfSlC/nUHFEJIGjnKTzjGKGmJibjJlv3dT0h/uStL2QdJTjGpP6s7DkY534os61YjYvHLVkAr6E9pDaZKkd4pQQ34KV4%2bgHjT8ttlqW6mMXCyD8pdwFYwOcbURdKXyBbmZyZ8Fl74iG%2bwmcMqU2tSCEbfpGdsADnNMdMwkSbg%2b%2b4UKUyAUNqGdR017IVxqGu4ysxJsV%2b5WJtsstB34Z8NHcL7s4qMQUnB5reul7LaZS0O3U3JS9Gs6EKIPBOMA8Z4FZN2gwkQepJ7TCCllt9SEZ5I8CfWp8XFB20kSh8ZQAk9YNxJJiQHGNc0KUVEIbdKUaiNOogHyyPan/iW332VOSLmhGVKWS6VaSU6fl9SABnywOK1zpns3u90/xoLLJOFOrOlGePufajdPYhcCwnvOoo6XEjSEdysgen9FE8KLuzOa2Uk2Pye05pmPxnoyh3txW6Rn6rmpJVtz/NE3Zj0/AnT0y%2bpdabGvWwvu1fUUrAIOBvoBxlQ8dqNuveyzqCyxnJMoCbCH5pEc60pxxqGAR7kfeg6HfDDlwGLshz8NhshkJj7L0DUopB81rIyrypHDYRaDV/bSrhtLelmr73InWsKy9OdUvtdOT/xFhtKS2TulCiMkE/rx/Pj5VD6euZdvX1yyyqQpISpIS0hKgMD0TnH7%2b9Ulznv3G5Sp0tRW/IcLiz6n%2b4qdZG7XJ0sTmJy31KJ1MPtoTowNvnGM8%2bPjWzKHBJhPIVN8sJuER9lxxiW6IraltqZWAknG/NYT1VdVXK7zHyMF59bywDnCieM%2bNT24sRBLC27qY/IaFzYSnTvnO%2bPKqi8t2yOkNQ481qQAkkuyG3EYxv8AkHn61Niw6GLEzfJl1gD4neUdtDLaENJDaEDCUpGAkeQp7ApUqvM5AkxADjbRWASflPqOMHzrlHt3sUCzdYTI9uZ7lhTaHg2OEFQyQPIelKlSma4/dMVeACyBTkKbJiKPwr7jOSCdBxkjj/ppUqzHWWbR38XuJwDOfwDkfNwaZlzpUtKUypDrwSSUhZzgnmlSpIZ//9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"title":"Community incentive program","path":"/blog/community-incentive-program/","date":"November 20, 2020","description":"With the launch of Robonomics Web Services beta test, Robonomics Network is shifting to higher growth pace.

This underlying amount of XRT will be distributed among the KSM holders who will support the project with their tokens at the upcoming auction of Polkadot’s wild cousin.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that this offer will be 1.5 times more profitable compared to KSM staking. Moreover, during the period of the next 2 years, we will be preparing for the Polkadot slot auction that is expected to be set within the $ 3.2-6.4 million price range.\n\nBelow you will find the calculations and explanation of our chosen strategy with regards to the Kusama auction in 2020 and the Polkadot auction in 2022.\n\n![\"Robonomics Parachain on Kusama first\"](./images/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/Robonomics_Parachain-web.jpg)\n## Robonomics Parachain on Kusama first\n\nAs the Polkadot ecosystem makes its first steps, we understand that our goals must take into account not only the network’s final architecture, but also all important milestones in the future development of the network. We, the Robonomics developers team, believe that Kusama will serve as the primary pillar of Polkadot development in the upcoming 2 years, and hence, it is the Kusama network that we would like to concentrate all our efforts on.\n\n> “Kusama first” is our development strategy in the Polkadot ecosystem for the next 2 years.\n\nAccording to preliminary estimates, one slot of the Kusama network is enough to service up to 10,000 [digital twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin) of IoT devices at once with a subscription price of less than $10 per month. This will allow Robonomics to debug the process of connecting IoT systems during the lease of the Kusama slot. Next, we will be ready to scale the network to 1 million IoT systems connected in real-time by transforming the Robonomics network from Kusama Parachain to Polkadot Relay Chain.\n\n![\"Robonomics Relay Chain on Polkadot is the vision\"](./images/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/Robonomics_Relay_Chain-web.jpg)\n## Robonomics Relay Chain on Polkadot is the vision\n\nBy the time the Polkadot network is technically ready to accept 100 parachain projects, and the Kusama network is successfully connected as a parachain in the Polkadot slot, Robonomics will be ready to introduce its own parachain of parachains to multiply the bandwidth. Based on our estimates, the Robonomics Relay Chain will allow the Polkadot network to serve up to 1 million IoT systems simultaneously with a subscription price of $2.\n\n## Initial Parachain Offering and Robonomics Parachain Lease Offering\nWe recommend reading the following articles before continuing: [Obtaining a Parachain Slot on Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/obtaining-a-parachain-slot-on-polkadot/) and [Polkadot Parachain Slots](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-parachain-slots/).\n\nOur goal in this article is to outline a fair price for the Robonomics Parachain Lease Offering in 2020 based on the following factors:\n* Existing parameters of the launched Kusama and Polkadot networks;\n* The forecast of Parity developers and the Web3 Foundation team;\n* Community expectations versus current DOT and KSM staking rates.\n\nThe capitalization of the Kusama and Polkadot networks is estimated at $300 million and $4 billion respectively. At the moment, both networks have identical parameters: 10% inflation, 50% as target stake in the Relay chain and 100 parachains as the target number of projects in shared security. Given this data, we can estimate the 2-year slot lease in the Kusama network at $480,000, and $3,200,000 in the Polkadot network.\n\n> You can find our in-depth calculations here: [Robonomics Parachain strategy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LkKYNzwNABv6SQfCkZwRi99XW47xg6eR1-tdtp5CQIQ/).\n\nNow, let’s try to sequentially perform a follow-up calculation in the table below:\n\n### Step 1: Calculating the size of the KSM and DOT market available for auctions\n\nLet’s consider that the number of KSM and DOT within an ideal stake will always be blocked by the community. Then, we subtract it from the most realistic amount of cryptocurrency in constant circulation and presume that the trading volume equals to 10% of the total token circulation.\n\n| Total KSM: 10,000,000  | Total DOT: 1,000,000,000 |\n| - | - |\n| - 50% ideal stake ( -5,000,000 KSM)  | - 50% ideal stake ( -500,000,000 DOT)  |\n| - 10% trade balance ( -1,000,000 KSM)  | - 10% trade balance ( -100,000,000 DOT)  |\n| ** 4,000,000 KSM ** | ** 400,000,000 DOT ** |\n\n4,000,000 KSM and 400,000,000 DOT - the size of the available cryptocurrency for bonding to parachains.\n\n> Please note, that due to inflation, the total number of tokens will experience a year on year increase, but to simplify calculations, we do not take into account the increase in total supply. Moreover, we believe that the growth rate itself will not be significant enough in the first couple of years.\n\n### Step 2: Estimating the expected return on the staking of KSM and DOT\n\nThe current inflation rate of 10% per year can be revised next year using the on-chain governance function, but we assume that this indicator will not be revised in the next 1.5-2 years. This means that the holders of KSM and DOT tokens can expect the return from the IPO of Polkadot projects to be at the level of 20% per annum. Resultantly, we can now calculate the expected return:\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Kusama shared security cost</th>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Polkadot shared security cost</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Target bond, KSM</td>\n            <td>4,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Target bond, DOT</td>\n            <td>400,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n         <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, $</td>\n            <td>$48,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>$640,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\nAs you can see, with the current capitalization of the Kusama and Polkadot networks, the parachains should in total, generate KSM and DOT token holders, a return of about $50,000,000 and $650,000,000 respectively every 2 years.\n\n> ** Compound or simple interest in the calculation? **\n\n> We do not believe that the formula of compound interest of staking reward accumulation is worth using and is applicable at this time. Robonomics and other parachains will offer DOT and KSM blocking schemes, where the reward will be accumulated either in full at the beginning of the slot lease, or in part during the entire lease period, whilst the funds themselves will be transferred to the address of the holder without restricting access to them. This means that making calculations based on simple interest is more realistic and more convenient.\n\n### Step 3: Estimating the cost of shared security for one parachain slot\nPolkadot developers are aiming to set 100 parachains with 1,000 validators within the Kusama and Polkadot Relay chains. Therefore, in our calculations, the Robonomics developers propose to take into account the target division of the shared security cost. This, in turn, means that the expected return from blocking KSM and DOT tokens is divided into 100 projects in our calculations.\n\nIn this case, we arrive to almost the same indicators of the network security annual costs, as mentioned in the article [Polkadot Parachain Slots](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-parachain-slots/) (~$200,000 per year). Of course, this relates only to the Kusama network, since the cost of Polkadot shared security is already high today ($3,200,000 per year). Nevertheless, given the transition of Robonomics to the Relay Chain state, we will be able to afford these security expenses and thereby provide the IoT market with the most secure globally accessible network in the world, the protection of which is already estimated at $4 billion.\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Kusama shared security cost</th>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Polkadot shared security cost</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Target bond, KSM</td>\n            <td>4,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Target bond, DOT</td>\n            <td>400,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, $</td>\n            <td>$48,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>$640,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parachains, total</td>\n            <td>100</td>\n            <td>Parachains, total</td>\n            <td>100</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Shared security cost annual per parachain</td>\n            <td>$240,000.00</td>\n            <td>Shared security cost annual per parachain</td>\n            <td>$3,200,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Lease period, month</td>\n            <td>24</td>\n            <td>Lease period, month</td>\n            <td>24</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected reward per parachain</td>\n            <td>$480,000.00</td>\n            <td>Expected reward per parachain</td>\n            <td>$6,400,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n## On-Chain Governance Strategy\n\nThe beginning of the Robonomics’ parachain existence will be supported with funds allocated by the developers’ DAO. In the future, we plan that commissions from the monthly subscription activations for digital twins of IoT systems will be accumulated on the On-Chain Treasury account (minus the commission of the collators and the further development fund). Funds from the treasury will be governed by the parachain technical committee for participation in the subsequent auctions of Kusama and Polkadot slots. Potentially, funds in the form of a 2-year commission should be sufficient enough to extend the slot lease after Robonomics transitions to the Relay Chain state.\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Robonomics Parachain on Kusama</th>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Robonomics Relay chain on Polkadot</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>tps</td>\n            <td>1,500.00</td>\n            <td>tps</td>\n            <td>300,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>block time</td>\n            <td>6</td>\n            <td>block time</td>\n            <td>4</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>IoT Monthly subscriptions, max</td>\n            <td>9,000.00</td>\n            <td>IoT Monthly subscriptions, max</td>\n            <td>1,200,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Subscription price</td>\n            <td>$10.00</td>\n            <td>Subscription price</td>\n            <td>$2.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>2 years leasing slot total commissions</td>\n            <td>$2,160,000.00</td>\n            <td>2 years leasing slot total commissions</td>\n            <td>$57,600,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, %</td>\n            <td>2%</td>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, %</td>\n            <td>2%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, total</td>\n            <td>$43,200.00</td>\n            <td>Parachain collators incentive, total</td>\n            <td>$1,152,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Treasury</td>\n            <td>$2,116,800.00</td>\n            <td>Treasury</td>\n            <td>$56,448,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td></td>\n            <td></td>\n            <td>Robonomics Relay chain validators incentive</td>\n            <td>$15,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\nCommission rates for collators will be determined by the democracy module, as well as inflation rates after the launch of the Robonomics Relay Chain.\n\n## Ecosystem strategy\n\nRobonomics is set to provide IoT devices with access to the Polkadot ecosystem, whilst Robonomics Parachains will store digital twins of these IoT devices. Within the parachain itself, users will be offered similar and even equivalent functions that are currently offered by other existing IoT cloud platforms such as AWS IoT, Azure IoT. In addition to standard IoT market functions implementations, for example, remote device launch and telemetry capture, Robonomics will be able to integrate with other projects in the eco-environment as they appear.\n\nWe believe that within 2 years, the list of available Polkadot ecosystem opportunities for the IoT market will be as follows:\n* Storage and management of cyber-physical systems’ digital twins in the Robonomics parachain;\n* Money for robots: integration of the most popular cryptocurrencies and tokens from the Polkadot ecosystem through XCMP;\n* Smart contracts for robots: access to smart contracts using a bridge to Ethereum and support for EVM in parachains such as Plasm, Moonbeam, Edgeware;\n* NFT identity for mobile robotics through projects such as Acala and Distributed Sky whitepaper;\n* Tokenization of data from IoT devices for the environmental liability market based on DAO IPCI;\n* A managed access to IoT systems using DAO for collective management of public, corporate and private spaces;\n* Robotics Smart leasing and bond issue for the installation of robots in smart cities with distribution in the DeFi market.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nRobonomics is an infrastructure project for the Polkadot network, which aims to place more than 1 million digital twins of IoT devices with a level of security and global availability that the cloud platforms operated by IT corporations cannot provide. Robonomics developers will provide integration for these digital twins with ecosystem projects and thereby open access to previously inaccessible tools for automation systems of city living, logistics and production, namely, direct access to fintech solutions without banks.\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-cover-web.62c183a.0a239770c06887970e47fe72652c3f12.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-cover-web.9ea8d39.0a239770c06887970e47fe72652c3f12.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-cover-web.6b2ed88.0a239770c06887970e47fe72652c3f12.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robonomics-parachain-bond-offering-cover-web.62c183a.0a239770c06887970e47fe72652c3f12.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-3c9ebd43c9b3aeb43553232bcaa42135'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-3c9ebd43c9b3aeb43553232bcaa42135)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAQQDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAABBgcCAwgF/8QALBAAAQMDAgUCBgMAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFEQYSEyExQVEHYQgUInGBkSQyQv/EABgBAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBAMB/8QAIxEAAQQCAgEFAQAAAAAAAAAAAgABAxEEIRJBMQVRweHw8f/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A6ppA%2b9I0qELB11tptTjq0obSMqUo4AHkmvHs2poF5lTWrcXHWooG%2bRjDRJ7A9T%2bsVWnrhrK2abnRYOoo14nx5Lanmm4K22m28Hb9RUcqV3GeXtUNtnr9pKLZja29M3NuKtBQ6lDzKeJkYJJC85I96dgd60t3fHGF92fXTN8v%2b8ropdxSmREaS044JAyHEDKU8vNFOPtN7eI4hG9WxO5QG5Xge9UBbviC05Dt7UODZLsxHbQG208ZlRQB05qUT%2b6kPp1r63avcmwbZZJRMBXzbIecQQhaiQkf35/6PYfmgojZ7rXupxIXbztXDg%2bR%2bqcZ7mhoMn5lokoW04nAWhWMpOM45feiBSLqemNOaWKEKJ620HZdZhsXlL54aChJaXtOCc%2bDUBm%2bjOh4rqg/e7s27gpLfz6AcY6Y2VYsuS9crpNhqdWzFiFCVJaVtU6VDPNQ5gDwOvemTb0NpCYSkxUgYw22mm5lVWqo8UB2b7ff7%2bKvoHpDouSUtsXy6qexzaE9BUM%2b2ytts0FadA3d1NglSUiUyOMh98LWQCcdAMDmfv8Aip4qAl0/y1pkpxja42nkfIOM0BKtsZ2422HPSuZBW4eGy8snhqAyDnqpPLoc9evao/UYZcvGKAD48u1tHFGB8x3XX39IrRkt12VOYdkNuJG1aE5%2bsDpz7kcutSugLPaYdnjKj25ngsqWV7ASQknxnoPaj6MLHLGgCEy5OLVajmNjNyZqtf/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}}]}}},"context":{}}
