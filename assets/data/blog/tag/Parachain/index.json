Robonomics and other parachains will offer DOT and KSM blocking schemes, where the reward will be accumulated either in full at the beginning of the slot lease, or in part during the entire lease period, whilst the funds themselves will be transferred to the address of the holder without restricting access to them.

Therefore, in our calculations, the Robonomics developers propose to take into account the target division of the shared security cost. This, in turn, means that the expected return from blocking KSM and DOT tokens is divided into 100 projects in our calculations.</p>\n<p>In this case, we arrive to almost the same indicators of the network security annual costs, as mentioned in the article <a href=\"https://polkadot.network/polkadot-parachain-slots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Polkadot Parachain Slots</a> (~$200,000 per year). Of course, this relates only to the Kusama network, since the cost of Polkadot shared security is already high today ($3,200,000 per year). Nevertheless, given the transition of Robonomics to the Relay Chain state, we will be able to afford these security expenses and thereby provide the IoT market with the most secure globally accessible network in the world, the protection of which is already estimated at $4 billion.</p>\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Kusama shared security cost</th>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Polkadot shared security cost</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Total target bond, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Target bond, KSM</td>\n            <td>4,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Target bond, DOT</td>\n            <td>400,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n            <td>Lock period, years</td>\n            <td>2</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>40%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, $</td>\n            <td>$48,000,000.00</td>\n            <td>Expected return from 2 years bonding, %</td>\n            <td>$640,000,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parachains, total</td>\n            <td>100</td>\n            <td>Parachains, total</td>\n            <td>100</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Shared security cost annual per parachain</td>\n            <td>$240,000.00</td>\n            <td>Shared security cost annual per parachain</td>\n            <td>$3,200,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Lease period, month</td>\n            <td>24</td>\n            <td>Lease period, month</td>\n            <td>24</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Expected reward per parachain</td>\n            <td>$480,000.00</td>\n            <td>Expected reward per parachain</td>\n            <td>$6,400,000.00</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"on-chain-governance-strategy\"><a href=\"#on-chain-governance-strategy\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>On-Chain Governance Strategy</h2>\n<p>The beginning of the Robonomics’ parachain existence will be supported with funds allocated by the developers’ DAO.
