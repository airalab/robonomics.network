He has been developing Rust bindings for ROS 2 for several years. We want to share the story of this project, explain how we helped Esteve, and why having Rust is useful for robotics applications.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## From ROS 1 to ROS 2\n\nROS was initially created as the development environment for specific types of robots. Primarily, the first version of the operating system was intended for single robots with computing resources on board and a reliable network connection with no need for real-time control. Accordingly, developers initially thought that ROS 1 would be best suited for research and academic applications.\n\nHowever, ROS eventually went beyond the research community and was adopted for commercial use. To meet the needs of new use cases, developers set out to add new features, such as support for multi-robot and small embedded systems, and integration with real-time. They also decided to improve the API and incorporate new technologies that had emerged since the release of ROS 1. At the same time, they chose not to change the existing version of the Robot Operating System, as this would have had a major impact on existing applications. As a result [ROS 2](https://design.ros2.org/) was born. \n\n## About Esteve\n\nEsteve was one of the original team who [started developing](https://www.ros.org/news/2016/04/dirk-thomas-esteve-fernandez-and-william-woodall-osrf-state-of-ros-2.html) the second version of ROS. He is a robotics engineer with more than two decades of experience in open source development and self-driving cars. Even after leaving the core ROS 2 team , he has continued to actively contribute to the project's repositories. \n\nOne of Esteve's personal goals was to develop projects that enable developers to write ROS 2 applications in Rust (bindings, code generator and more), providing them with a powerful tool to create efficient, robust robotics programs. However, the project developed rather slowly at first, as Esteve worked on it practically alone for 4 years, in his free time. \n\nAbout a year and a half ago, we met Esteve and agreed to help him with the development of ros2-rust. Thanks to this, Esteve was able to allocate extra time to work on the project and attract more attention to it. The ROS2 community on Rust has grown, and others have also started to contribute to the project with reviews by Esteve. Now the [main repository](https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust) has 27 contributors, 75 forks and 466 stars on Github.\n\n## Progress of Development\n\nAt the moment, ros2-rust has already implemented support for message generation, publisher/subscriber mechanism, clients and services. One of our big goals is to develop Robonomics as ROS 2 Middleware, and this requires adding a Robonomics transport layer for ros2-rust. To implement this functionality, support for the libp2p communication library is being added instead of the standard Data Distribution Service (DDS) for ROS2. DDS provides a publish-subscribe transport in a distributed discovery way, allowing any two programs to communicate without the need for a centralized tool like the ROS master. But DDS requires developing an additional bridge for adding Robonomics to ROS2, while libp2p allows native Robonomics integration.\n\n![ros-2-stack](./images/ros-2-rust-report-2022/ros-client-library-api-stack.png)\n\n*Diagram of the ROS client library API stack showing the position of the ROS 2 Middleware (rmw). Source: [ROS 2 Documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Concepts/About-Internal-Interfaces.html)*\n\n## Why ROS2 on Rust?\n\nBesides being the main language for Robonomics on Substrate, Rust has significant advantages for robotic applications.\n\nGenerally, for the most widely used robotic platforms intended for commercial and large-scale deployment, C++ is used, and so it was added first for ROS. This is due to its ability to work ‘close to the hardware’ and its suitability for robotic applications with limited computing resources. However, this also makes C++ more dangerous, as it is very easy to make a critical mistake during development, and these mistakes are only discovered later on real (and broken) hardware.\n\nThis is where the advantages of Rust come in. It enables low-level development, like C++, but with added memory safety. This safety comes without additional runtime costs, preserving the application's high execution speed. Furthermore, Rust makes the development of complex and risky robotic projects more efficient.\n\n## Future Plans\n\nIn the near future, Esteve plans to add actions (asynchronous calls to a node’s functionality) in ros2-rust. They allow a client to track the progress of a request, get the final outcome, and optionally cancel the request before it completes. This, in particular, allows robots to create queries, for example, for navigation and localization purposes.\n\nLong-term plans include building a ROS 2 prototype launched on top of the Robonomics Network. This will allow us to use Robonomics on Substrate to create a WebAssembly app that can run ROS2 from a browser on the Robonomics decentralized cloud. We look forward to a new course at [Robonomics Academy](https://robonomics.academy) dedicated to ROS 2 and working directly from any browser!","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.268586f3596831daf0d2d0fa2c885458.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.268586f3596831daf0d2d0fa2c885458.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.268586f3596831daf0d2d0fa2c885458.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.268586f3596831daf0d2d0fa2c885458.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-5417e22015af8beea4d00164d88e273f'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-5417e22015af8beea4d00164d88e273f)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEBgcFAf/EACsQAAEDAwMDAwMFAAAAAAAAAAECAwQABRESIUEGMVFhgZETMqEUIyRxkv/EABgBAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUCAwQG/8QAJxEAAQQBAwMDBQAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxEEEiFBBXGBEzEyQlFhkbH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMDp8GI7OlIjx06nVnCU%2baRXV6ejSjNRNYGhiIoOuvLyEJSO4JA5G2BSsbdTwEdPJ6cZcDR4v78JN4tUi1OstShhbiNewOBv2zz7eanwOnXZMFElxwpDgyhKEpUQONWVA7gE4GdhVu6/eiiylTkUureIDLw3CD3znjbjmqzbLtIbtjX8d76bCgVLaCcPAAgJVkcDI2ztxW%2bTGhhmLHbikPDnZOTiiVgp10fbft/FX5UZyNKXHcxrScZB2PII9Mb0pQ0qI8eKmPyf1cxyS6EIKzshGwSAMAAeMYFIkFKjqSRnxR7gLOlMsc6gH%2b9b90miiioK1eoSVrSkd1EAe9Xa%2bzBablbracC1pbQHmhsHASQc/GapTR0uoPhQP5rXZEKO7f46pDLTxUwsD6iArTgpII/0RSWDEZGu0mjYQXV52wyR%2boLFO2/NDfuOFGvFhbetc5CHJL6y1%2bwlbpUEY3ASP7HOaqt4kP8AT9kj2ZCkGQ8hT0g4B0auyR8HetAuTyo1olPN41tMqWnI2yBtWOXKc9cZrsuSQXXDk42A8Aela%2bouZD8NnEV4R3Q2yZViU2xpvzVDxz3Uxs25LiS4EFABzpSTwcbbelMQbZrRkNBBUe5Xkfdkq8j7cfmuNRQ4lrgLpTj39R/amSRHTDYDSm1u6iVFIUCBwCD859qh0UVBxtXNbpFXa//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Bonus lesson in Robonomics winter school 2022, telescope","path":"/blog/online-winter-school-2022-lesson-telescope/","date":"February 24, 2022","description":"In this lesson, we will show you possibly our most inspiring app so far.

We want to devote the next year to the development of Robonomics as an already working infrastructure, focusing on the most viable web3 application scenarios in the area of the Internet of Things. In this context, the key thing is that we have the relevant experience and a team willing to devote their time to research development and more. \n\nNext, I will try to tell you about the products that we plan to release so as to provide Robonomics users with web3 application scenarios for IoT, which are useful in everyday life.\n\n## Kusama – a network for connecting personal IoT infrastructure and start-up projects; Polkadot – for corporate\n\nThis is how we imagine the development of Robonomics as a parachain. We want to start by implementing on the Kusama network, which features enough cybersecurity to service home robotics but is not suitable for big corporate accounts. In the context of B2B applications, Kusama is only suitable for start-up projects. And this would be so, at least until each release in Kusama is accompanied by an independent audit of the code and other components that are important for integration into the business processes of large companies.\n\n![\"Kusama and Polkadot plans\"](./images/trajectory-2022-heading-for-product-launches/Kusama_Polkadot.jpg)\n\nThus, users of Robonomics 2022 are the owners of home IoT infrastructure and start-up projects, which are interested in the possibilities of web3, and they are ready to trust something new :) \n\nFurther information on our plans for this user category, next year.\n\n## RWS: Robonomics for your smart home\n\nDuring 2020, a basic architecture was developed for representing the parachain as a familiar cloud for IoT devices. Moving forward, part of the future infrastructure of Robonomics in a parachain format, will be called RWS.\n\nIn 2021, numerous [experiments were conducted to connect popular smart home solutions to RWS services](https://youtu.be/H-w2FX-zd0M). Developers are now ready to provide a monthly subscription service for those who already use a home IoT infrastructure and would like to try web3-based services. \n\nSome of the specific actions we have completed, to connect a smart home controlled by the Kusama network, are as follows:\n\n* Completed the initial connection with [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant), the most famous opensource solution in the field of smart home control, and will continue to develop this area to decouple the existing IoT hubs in homes from cloud services;\n* Started the release and global distribution of the first IoT hub, which will be [compatible with sensors operating under the Zigbee protocol](https://www.amazon.com/zigbee-sensor/s?k=zigbee+sensor) in the spring of 2022;\n* Continuation of the [series of publications and instructions](https://blog.aira.life/coworking-for-crypto-anarchists-p1-5ebecb252f2d) on how to organise space in a team without the tyranny of the administrator, but only with a light electric shock from Rosie's home robot.\n\nBesides providing control via the Kusama network, we want to allow everyone who cares about the word “dapp” to try Robonomics applications.\n\n## Robonomics-based applications for end users\n\nOver 50 people have participated in R&D projects based on Robonomics over the past 5 years. As a result, we can see the emergence of teams specialising in specific applications, which are ready to offer users a product or service.\n\nIn fact, this evolution arises from the growth of the R&D team: from a team that exclusively publishes reports and instructions from specialists, into a whole ecosystem of teams that have specialized for specific scenarios while helping to write different pieces of the software platform. Today, the platform already has more than ten commonly used repositories for specific types of dapps, IoT connectivity, or building more complicated things. Below are some of them, or rather some of Robonomics' applications that are now turning into separate start-up projects with the developers' participation.\n\n### The Robodog is used not only for training but also for inspiration\n\nThe remote training programme for working with BD Spot is moving towards certification of specialists, with the issuance of diplomas of additional education in a university format and building corporate training programs, which, I think, will be implemented over the next year. This area is nonetheless extremely closed, like a school of magic in any fantasy universe. But the Robodog has another interesting feature: due to its popularity in society, Spot can be useful in simpler scenarios, for example, feeling like a robot operator from the future. During 2022, we want to create a separate opportunity to rent a Spot unit and a track. With that, we'll open a portal to a world of inspiration for children who cannot play football or conduct other physical activity. After all, imagine how abruptly your view of what you can do will change after controlling a Robodog for an hour. We will attempt to launch such a programme together with a charitable foundation to help those children who are already struggling in a challenging developmental stage to pursue a future career in robotics.\n\n### Vegan techie\n\nI rarely admit it but I have been a vegetarian for over 7 years – although I try to stay away from meetings with other vegetarians :) Perhaps this is specific to Russia, but looking at the interests of vegetarians, I notice with apprehension the tendencies towards a \"back-to-the-middle-ages\" lifestyle, i.e., natural resources grown by yourself, no waste – because you eat only vegetables... Needless to say, saving the Earth from our ignorance is necessary. And yet, I believe more in robots and their work as guards of the goddess Gaia than in any eco-trends. \n\nTo support those aiming to live in harmony with nature while adhering to the principle \"it is a machine, not a person\", we are launching a project to automatically offset the carbon footprint of electricity anywhere in the world. Buy a smart socket for your home, connect to Robonomics, and install a bundle with the DAO IPCI application in the [Robonomics marketplace](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services). Thus, your smart home will autonomously consider the monthly power consumption and compensate for the environmental damage caused by the generation of this electricity by donating small cryptocurrency amount. \n\nTo realise this scenario, the company Evercity helped acquire the carbon credits of two verified projects, which are traded on a European exchange. There is one additional launch. This service will be launched in February-March 2022.\n\n### The first civilian sensor network in Russia using IPFS and Substrate Blockchain\n\nFor the third year in a row, the city of Tolyatti – incidentally where many project participants were born – has been experimenting with building urban monitoring using autonomous IoT sensors. In 2021, over 25 sensors throughout the city sent data to Robonomics, and a monitoring map was created in dapp format. Dozens of public ecologists have regularly worked with the map since the summer of 2021.\n\nFind out more on the [website](https://airalab.org/en/) of the non-profit organisation Airalab Rus, Tolyatti.\n\nBy the way, the touch map is globally available– feel free to connect as tens of those interested have already done. Here's a sample video from the community:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AQ7ZzgbN7jU\n\n### Feecc - quality control system for small factories\n\nA student group from ITMO together with LLC \"Multi-agent systems\" created and tested a quality control system at two enterprises that can be easily integrated into an assembler's workplace or into an element of a conveyor line. The system will be offered at a low price and features a high data protection level.\n\nThe Feecc hardware and software complex will be available for purchase in 2022 at https://multi-agent.io/\n\n### A portal from the metaverse to the real world\n\nMerklebot's product team is preparing to launch an integration with Chilean telescopes designed for deep-space photography. The telescope will be controlled with the help of the Robonomics' dapp. Moreover, you will be able to take a picture of the sky and send a friend a “Hello from Alpha Centauri” NFT postcard!\n\n![\"NFT from online telescope\"](./images/trajectory-2022-heading-for-product-launches/NFT.jpg)\n\n## Annex 1: contacting with the community\n\nThroughout the year the Robonomics custdev team conducted interviews with developers, professionals and experts from the fields of robotics, engineering, IoT and cloud technologies to get their point of view on web3, distributed technologies and understand the problems they face when developing software applications and technical solutions. We also collected feedback about Robonomics, and in which use cases our platform could be useful in the opinion of the respondents. Below we would like to share our findings based on these interviews.\n\n**Statistics by respondents:**\n\n* Total interviews: 156 respondents\n* Geography: European countries (36%), India (22%), USA (19%), other countries (23%)\n* Areas of activity: ROS developers, robotics engineers, IoT engineers, startup founders, students and professors: Computer science, Robotics, Mechanical Engineering\n\nIn general, robotic and IoT software developers still vaguely understand the concept of web3, or know about it, but do not use these technologies in their professional work. For some respondents, the idea of using blockchain and smart contracts to securely manage a network of devices was quite a surprise. Nevertheless, discussing the general problems of robotics, many developers have come to the same conclusions that we have come to: for the full-scale implementation of robotic devices in the future, the question of their reliable authentication will inevitably arise. Web3 technologies can be a possible solution, which, moreover, will make it possible to democratize and decentralize access to robots for all of humanity.\n\nOverall, the responses highlight the idea that the manufacturing industry wants to change its old business model, but does not yet know how to do it painlessly. Several specialists from B2B industries in interviews noted that large companies, on the one hand, are worried about the reliability of IoT connectivity through conventional networks, but on the other hand, they are not yet ready for web3 solutions as an alternative. The respondents were advised to demonstrate streamlined use cases that provide more profitable and less costly security than current, centralized solutions. A niche is open here for solutions like Robonomics, and according to one respondent, the motto “be robotically capable, but human readable” is a good approach to disseminate our ideas. The main obstacle was most often called the legal nuances of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, as well as the fact that we propose to preserve the confidentiality of data sent by user devices, which may contradict the business models of some companies.\n\nAmong the most frequent mentions in the stories of respondents was the problem of the high cost and complexity of deploying robotic solutions. Our common conclusion with the respondents was that the application of the concept of “robot-as-a-service” and smart leasing can make IoT and robots more accessible. \n\nAmong the use cases, for which, according to the respondents, the use of Robonomics is most attractive, scenarios with a public network (traffic management, environmental management), production / collection  / storage of environmental data, IoT solutions for small businesses, creation of digital twins were named.\n\nNext, we would like to introduce some of the noticeable respondents and their interesting stories.\n\n<Card>\n\n### [Kapil Deshpande](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kapil-deshpande-041193/)\n\n**Occupation:** Robotics Software Developer (ROS); **Experience:** ROS, Azure.\n\nDuring an interview with Kapil, it turned out that we came to the same ideas in different ways. While participating in Azure Hackathon, Kapil and his colleagues decided to develop a robot-as-a-service system for business based on blockchain and ROS — similar to Robonomics core elements at the beginning. Kapil believes that the cost of the robot's work to the final product price can be accurately calculated using smart contracts that link economic and technical information. Both us and he were very amused to hear our common ideas, conveyed in other words, independently of each other. As a result of his acquaintance with Robonomics, Kapil decided to apply for our grant program and take courses at the Robonomics Academy.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### [Houman Masnavi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/houman-masnavi/)\n\n**Occupation:** Software Developer; **Experience:** ROS with different robots — PAL Robotics TIAGo, KUKA youBot, MiR100, UR5, Jackal UGV, Turtlebot3, Parrot Bebop2.\n\nThe interview with Houman is a case where an engineer deeply immersed in robotics, mentioned in [the article](https://blog.ut.ee/robotics-wizard/) as a “robotics wizard”, became interested in the possibility of using web3 for robots. After several interviews, Houman became so interested in our project that he has become a full-fledged Robonomics tutor. He is currently supervising our wiki with meaningful comments on its structure and reviewing the quality of guides and video tutorials. \n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### [Primož Zajec](https://www.linkedin.com/in/primo%C5%BE-zajec-436099a6/)\n\n**Occupation:** Software Developer for Architectural Design of IoT and Industrial Systems; **Experience:** R&D development for IoT.\n\nPrimož learned about Robonomics by reading our R&D book. He was amazed by the platform and in the interview provided insightful feedback on Robonomics. Concluded that in his opinion “there is a market for Robonomics for sure”. Then he pitched Robonomics as a solution to the projects he thought the platform would fit into.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### [Dawit Legese](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawitlegese)\n\n**Occupation:** Java Developer; **Experience:** Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science.\n\nPrior to his role as a Java developer, Dawit worked on a humanoid robot project in which he and his colleagues attempted to integrate a controller into robots so that multiple robots could play soccer. For the data management of these robots, Dawit and his team were solely focused on interacting with live time data feeds as opposed to cloud data storage. Since most of the budget was spent on purchasing robots, Dawit had to take a much greater risk in conducting the experiment, because robots were the cheapest and a computer for processing live data was the simplest. Having learned about the smart leasing model that Robonomics allows to implement, Dawit became extremely interested in it.\n\n</Card>\n\n## Annex 2: Robonomics grant program: results of the year\n\nIn May 2021, Robonomics opened its own [grant program](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-program) to support students, young scientists and academic professionals in fields of cyber-physical systems, Industry 4.0 and IoT. The grant program has already successfully completed one round of proposals, and the second phase is now actively underway. On the eve of the new year, we would like to review the results of the outgoing one, talk about the success of old projects and the launch of new ones.\n\nThe stats for grant proposals are as follows:\n\n* Forks of the grant repository — 12\n* Submitted proposals — 6\n* Approved proposals — 3\n\nAs we noted in [the first round report](https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-grant-program-the-first-round-is-completed-the-second-round-is-ahead-7ff1dfb80722), we began to select projects more carefully, giving preference to applicants from the research and academic community. Therefore, the latest proposals come from students and professors of European universities, and in many cases, an important result of the project would be the publication in high-quality scientific journals and presentations at scientific conferences.\n\nNow let's take a look at the status of already launched projects (detailed results are available in [this repository](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-results)), and then discuss new proposals.\n\n### Progress of launched projects\n\n<Card>\n\n#### [Robossembler](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-program/blob/main/proposals/robossembler.md)\n\nSince April 2021, the team of the very first approved project has been creating a simulation model of a smart factory with a digital twin, which is able to create almost complete copies of itself. For 9 months of active work, the participants conducted a [voluminous study](https://robosphere.gitlab.io/robossembler-docs/docs/) on the principles of building self-replicated automatic systems that would be quite simple to implement. As a result, the basis of the production cell is a workplace in the form of a honeycomb with a 6-DOF manipulator, to which a set of various tools and machines can be connected (from soldering and welding to CNC machine and 3D printer). For each element of the production system, a STEP model [was created](https://gitlab.com/robosphere) that can simulate the operation of these nodes.\n\nThe Robossembler team tried several frameworks for simulation and so far they use a bundle of ROS2 + Unity for multi-agent scenarios and ROS2 + Ignition Gazebo simulator for modeling small manipulation tasks. ROS2-tools PlanSys2 and MoveIt2 are used as a system for planning actions and interactions of many participating devices. The team continues to work on the architecture for integrating Robonomics and recently submitted an article to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society journal about the concept of transferring skills and assembly programs between devices to launch new products.\n\n![\"Modular workspace for scalability of the production system\"](./images/trajectory-2022-heading-for-product-launches/Robossembler.png)\n\n*Modular workspace for scalability of the production system*\n\nThe team publishes all the results and everyone can try to test some of the modules of the factory. It is noteworthy that the team develops all the elements based on realistic prototypes, and provides the real design documentation for them. Who knows, maybe the next step after the simulation is to build a real self-replicating factory...\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n#### [AgriDataTrade](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-program/blob/main/proposals/agridatatrade.md)\n\nA team from New Zealand is working to create a system that facilitates environmental regulation of the use of farm areas. For this purpose, the AgriDataTrade project organizes on farms a secure automated collection of various data on soil conditions (nitrates, phosphates, greenhouse gases, etc.), in order to then launch data tokenization. Ultimately, this will create a soil credit market similar to the carbon credit one.\n\nThe AgriDataTrade project was launched 4 months ago and during this period the team received the necessary sets of sensors (Hach sensors capable of measuring pH, nitrates, conductivity and other indicators) and agreed with several farms on their placement. To connect the sensors, an Arduino board is used, which, using the local mobile network via the MQTT protocol (see [repository](https://github.com/AgriData-Trade/robonomics_mqtt)), connects to a remote server that creates nodes for these sensors in Robonomics Network. The team has already deployed a server at Victoria University of Wellington and will launch a test network of sensors on one of the farms in a few weeks.\n\n![\"The test map on which the data from the sensors will be displayed\"](./images/trajectory-2022-heading-for-product-launches/AgriDataTrade.png)\n\n*The test map on which the data from the sensors will be displayed*\n\n</Card>\n\n### New projects\n\n<Card>\n\n#### [LogisticsBDT](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-program/blob/main/proposals/LogisticsBDT.md)\n\nThe latest project approved by the grant program is the Logistics Blockchain Digital Twin, proposed by a team of researchers from the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria and Tallinn University of Technology. The project aims at identifying counterfeit products and verifying the authenticity of products in high-value supply chains. This is a serious problem both for the users of the products and for the manufacturers themselves (for example, in the heavy industry, automotive, aviation, pharmaceuticals), as it creates additional economic and legal burdens in the control of the chain.\n\nThe researchers propose a system based on digital twins of products using IoT sensors (for example, RFID tags) and the Robonomics Network, which would guarantee the observance of authenticity and the transfer of rights. To test the capabilities of such a system, applicants intend to create a realistic simulation of such a supply chain, which will be managed by a control system based on sensors and Robonomics.\n\nBased on the results of the project, the authors are going to develop a specification for the use of blockchain systems and IoT in high-value supply chains and publish a number of articles on this topic.\n\n![\"Authentication system architecture\"](./images/trajectory-2022-heading-for-product-launches/LogisticsBDT.png)\n\n*Authentication system architecture*\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n#### [Location Based Identities in Industry 4.0 Production](https://github.com/SaschaKaven/robonomics-grant-program/blob/main/proposals/sensorchain_security_%20interface.md)\n\nThis project is still undergoing approval at the Robonomics DAO, but we would like to present it now, since it touches on the topic of the previous one. Researchers from Hamburg University of Applied Sciences also aim at ensuring the authenticity and integrity of product data during the manufacturing process, for which they propose to create digital identities of objects by data blockchainzation of various sensors (researchers call this mechanism as sensorchain). The team similarly proposes to use RFID tags for this, and provide identification of devices by mapping with the location of these devices (proof-of-location). Robonomics is used to create and store digital twins of products and sensors.\n\nBut in the project, the authors want to go further and assemble a test bench based on the Fischertechnik constructor, which will simulate a factory and on which all developments will be tested. This makes the project very interesting, since, firstly, Robonomics has [a similar factory](https://youtu.be/LjIB3-4kQ0A) built from such a constructor, and secondly, the development of the LogisticsBDT project can be quite simply synergized with this test bench to get additional results. So let's wish the team good luck!\n\nIt has been a productive year for Robonomics-based R&D projects and we hope the next one will be even more eventful.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-notification.png'\" :link=\"'https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics'\">\n\n### Join our Twitter\n\nStay tuned and follow updates\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.2a9dcd2570bd1840ee35e163c6e4a64b.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.2a9dcd2570bd1840ee35e163c6e4a64b.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.2a9dcd2570bd1840ee35e163c6e4a64b.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.2a9dcd2570bd1840ee35e163c6e4a64b.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-522ebc7a7465779872e214897aace1b3'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-522ebc7a7465779872e214897aace1b3)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAgIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAABAYFCAEHCQID/8QALxAAAgECBQIFAwMFAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABQYSIRMxBxRBUWEjcYEiMkKRoeHw8f/EABgBAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDBAIF/8QAJREAAQQBAgYDAQAAAAAAAAAAAQACESEDEjEEE0FRYXEigaHB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCtdMGlfbGNze1%2b/wAD5wfmVHUZZVNS10fSnVQxUkHgi47Y2h4V6P8ALaThz7M5ZpqLNJHSOmjTbDGYn2iSeax2HdcKoFzfuL4nvGXTmQTU/WELw6liy5VFNGz2klG3nYbkDZfbdu1hY4eMhJhon0PSpPDu5fNNDvIWgZHBxiliapqY4kBJYgWHfHimj6sqdcvFASVMmwm1h/z%2buJKmjWjLNBWxM4O7esbh1sCRbtx/jB1A7qYzFIfMsvqKLNJ6KSCWOaNyvScfrUg9j8jsftg2PLoIKbdPMs1TJdY4Y34B%2bT8YEq6iStkfzU5eTqECVgxdxYAckniwHHxgeHdBMjfUEYIJO23B7/2JGDsnYMjGn5Nk/gUhQQIK%2bkFRG1TTvIFZad7M/uoNuDyPTDnrTSWU5Bl7zwVlY0zOEhR%2bmUY8FhcG/AJPIHp74T6HzWZZrTQ5TTNLUtL1I4UBYs97/nsMGahz3Oswmmps9lleeKVt6TAho3vyLfx9eAMHVdLOQNDiGmlsyk01No2GE5zl1SWlvL0pa1ugVIJBaFB6he5J%2bQMMes462r0dFqKuigq4q9UEv1Te0ikEXHItwPxizs%2bS0k2cLmToDN5dqZlIBV0JvYi3%2b3whV2h8sfU1bTGKHyUtPvgpxEAlM9rblF7XFjbgWvirBxLAI2q/K578Dnm7PS4hU811kuZZTqvZlsbv5mOGpUUaFgJHTcV4H7rq1x8H2wu1y59Rxg1sFdTRpwOpCUVbg8cj2vjoNPoTKZ9MUuR1ivUUsbXclijSE7ib7SPVjx%2bPU4y%2bgshlq5Hq8vpZ45qZqUxtHwqFAjBeeNy3BPe1ueMc3NkccpLI0z9qzHAYA7dc%2bMtp8zzsT9F%2boKcddi7W54UAfJ7AffExrfR%2bd6UaBc4aBlnhSZdkqswU8C4HY3BHti7EXgroCCuNXTaehhmMgkOyWTbwwNtpawU2sQBaxI9cR9b4IaWzOdpa/wA3UG0ygPJcBXQqoAPA6dyV9icCTJTi5nLAbOq57eI/u/RUi0688VetTRSSR1VPaSN422lDe27d6WuPuSMfPNJ6qbMqqXMZJJatpC0zyG7MxPJJ%2bb4uivgFopq6SGKCqp4I7S7YZirMxYkXbvtXbwPk3J4sy5B4ZaWy2Ouy05XT1VMYYoQahN79IFmCMx/dZixDHnkD%2bIxrVcpK/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Monetizing Logs of Boston Dynamics Spot with Ocean Datatokens","path":"/blog/monetizing-logs-of-boston-dynamics-spot-with-ocean-datatokens/","date":"September 9, 2021","description":"In the last article, we presented our ROS package - ocean_ros, which connects the Ocean API and ROS, and also partially touched on the use case for selling technical logs from the robots.

In the [last article](/blog/ocean-protocol-p-2/), we presented our ROS package - ocean_ros, which connects the Ocean API and ROS, and also partially touched on the use case for selling technical logs from the robots. Today we will dive deeper into this use case and describe a specific example of devices’ data tokenization.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what real practical utility such data and datatokens created from it can bring. It is clear that the service information obtained during the operation of robots and devices is constantly reused to improve algorithms or user experience. But for the most part, this information does not go beyond the device's manufacturer itself. Difficulties begin when devices with a similar principle of operation appear on the market (e.g. robotic vacuum cleaners) or an open platform is released, which is positioned as the basis for other solutions (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, TurtleBot from ROS). For the first case, many of the same types of devices around the world generate gigantic amounts of data dedicated to one specific task. For the second case, developers of open platforms receive unique datasets in their projects in a variety of tasks. However, this experience is not aggregated and shared. It remains unavailable for analysis, which limits the system improvement and makes it hard to find new approaches in the control process.\n\nFor example, for motion planning of manipulators, inverse kinematics is a challenge. The joints’ parameters of the kinematic chain need to be found to move the end of the chain to the desired position and orientation. In other words, in order to move the end of the arm to the right position - we need to calculate the positions of every joint the arm has. Often this problem is solved analytically or numerically, but sometimes these approaches have problems, not least computational ones. With the rise of machine learning, [neural network approaches](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.protcy.2013.12.451) began to be used to solve the inverse kinematics, but they require [datasets](https://mint-lab.github.io/awesome-robotics-datasets/) that have information about the motion of a real device for training the model.\n\nSuch data needs to be collected and provided to interested parties. This is where [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/) datatokens come in. They allow automating this process and spur the market of robot datasets. Now this niche is occupied mostly by open datasets, but their main drawback is low quality for business use cases. Let’s move on to our example of robotic data tokenization.\n\n##  Meet Boston Dynamics spot selling its telemetry\n\nSpot is a relevant example of a complex multi-purpose platform with a wide variety of application scenarios. The fact is that working with real Spot telemetry is quite difficult, and this can greatly slow down the development of custom modules for the robot, and even more if the developer wants to use machine learning. Examples of operations that the developer could recover and study would be very useful here, but so far there is very little data available on the use of the robot, especially outside the United States. That's why we want our Spot to become a supplier of high-quality logs of the actual telemetry obtained when performing the same operations. This will give developers multiple repeated records of the same scenario, which should help them develop or improve their own solutions.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe main integration with the Ocean API is provided by our previously written ROS package - [*ocean_ros*](https://github.com/LoSk-p/ocean_ros) To link Spot SDK with ROS abstractions and to work with robot logs inside this operating system, we use [a driver](https://clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/spot-ros/ros_setup.html) created by Clearpath Robotics. You can learn more about how to collect telemetry using the Spot SDK in the [educational program](https://spot-sdk.education/) from our colleagues at Merklebot.\n\nAfter Spot executes any command, we get a file in rosbag format with data from the /tf ROS topic, which describes the position of Spot frames relative to each other. Frames represent parts of robots and surrounding objects that the robot can see with technical vision. The relationship between two frames is described by a three-element translation vector, which describes the difference between the positions of the origin of two frames, and a rotation quaternion, which shows the difference between rotations of the coordinate systems of two frames. The position of each frame is calculated in relation to the parent frame (for example, the hip relative to the body), the initial frame is the position of Spot at the start.\n\nAfter Spot executes any command, we get a file in rosbag format with data from the /tf ROS topic, which describes the position of Spot frames relative to each other.

Source: https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/about_spot.html*\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6i9zYpCMzn8\n\nThe video shows the sequence of commands for creating, selling and buying Spot telemetry datatokens (for more details on how the ocean_ros package works, [see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ssit8-u6dZY)). It should be noted that the rosbag file is pre-loaded into the IPFS file system to access it via a hash link, which is used when minting datatokens.\n\n![Spot on a 3D robot model](./images/monetizing-logs-of-boston-dynamics-spot-with-ocean-datatokens/Spot-on-a-3D-robot-model.jpg)\n\nThe video also demonstrates the purchase of these datatokens and an example of restoring the entire sequence of commands executed by Spot on a 3D robot model. To do this, we use the [rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) visualization tool for ROS. Thus, developers can work with any real Spot telemetry, even without having access to the robot.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/Robonomics_Ocean_p3_blog.62c183a.886ec03470834bc488dbc058e44e348f.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/Robonomics_Ocean_p3_blog.9ea8d39.886ec03470834bc488dbc058e44e348f.jpg 480w","/assets/static/Robonomics_Ocean_p3_blog.6b2ed88.886ec03470834bc488dbc058e44e348f.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/Robonomics_Ocean_p3_blog.62c183a.886ec03470834bc488dbc058e44e348f.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-3af47f1e4b2b46d1d5c9bef03e6585dc'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-3af47f1e4b2b46d1d5c9bef03e6585dc)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQFBgECBwD/xAAvEAABBAAEBAMIAwEAAAAAAAABAgMEEQAFBiESEzFBFCJhMlFicYGRodEWcpLw/8QAGQEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQAAgUG/8QAJREAAgIBBAEDBQAAAAAAAAAAAQIAEQMEITGBYQUSoRQyQVFx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDlM6ay2s0lJNXuT%2b8LQpy5DxYQkBKhZIJ29caSMoU4ricpN9ib/AwEFOXwnFMg8xXlCr/OOvZTdniYGPFQ%2b4nszTNZbsZxKWnl3XmF9MRq85ljfxMlJ/v%2b8eQ0uU4aSpQAK1kDfh/7b64PqKIzwMuwnnJHAynncTZTyyDRAvqkbV6H0wszVuJqYFFgGBb1NMaPnUHU/EKP3GCTtR5iy4WVR/DOgAlLgVxAEWNjXYg4W0rmbWU5umS82hVBPCVJsoIWlXED1BoHcEHfriT1jqGNmUJuK02gqQUKC6BUkUbANbAkiwKut7IvCj5nBoRk4U5qRTueTXi0Ey3W9gFkGt/fggzma0pwJmvOAewVUQfniJgrbTIQp0ApF9RYvth3xa0ynXWg2OIFPlG1YiuT%2bYFlANATo0LKWPBJm5vmLWXsOVyU1zHXU3RIQNwPcTQwReQZHmiJAiZ%2beGO1z31uMFKWmwQCdxud6AuySBiOcylt0gKdXYGyh1GNEZQQyWhLdDbtc1IApdbj7E3imq02qzEsmoK77ABaA7BN155/QgNO%2bPEoVsYPZu%2bjXxK1mDrDEh1qEpEiM2oht11kBS0%2b8jthRbcpQ4kRG1A9wyCMWY6YZWkHxLgv4Rga9KlV1mLwB%2bAYZZH9oC7/ANhUyqp3lQQmRHeW4Y7ZJG4cR5RfcDtjAmNzH2GJiWI0cuJDjrLA4kpvc%2btDti1/w%2b%2buZO/4H7wNWiGQCTNdNb%2bwMLNgykG4X6hI8/pLTEGFDfmaoWI8pCnYzrcUqDibroAaUCKKSbB%2bYwnP09Eby12dpjOWc0ZSlZkMqTyn229vNy1bqHWym62PyK5pPmRkRzmDvh2lKW23wCkqUACfrwp%2b2Ms6RYaBT4x88Q3IAH0wjg9O1mIhmzEm%2bCFqugDdeefG0u%2bpwsK9g%2bZ//9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Polkadot for the IoT market: Robonomics is ready for real world use cases on Kusama!","path":"/blog/polkadot-for-iot-with-robonomics/","date":"August 31, 2021","description":"The Robonomics team wants to impact the Kusama network development with four scenarios from the real world.

But before we can roll out these use cases we need to obtain a parachain in the [Kusama Parachain Auctions](https://kusama.network/auctions/). So, let’s talk about each of these current use cases.\n\n## Meet Spot, our Robodog\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_xBLkszEwWk\n\nThis summer, the first group of engineers learned to work with our own Spot as part of the [spot-sdk.education](https://spot-sdk.education) course. By the end of September, anyone, anywhere in the world can take our course and get his hands on with the robodog from [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot). The course is developed by robotics specialists from the [ITMO University](https://en.itmo.ru/) in St. Petersburg and [Merklebot](https://merklebot.com/) acting as the local operator in the San Francisco Bay Area lab, the home of our Spot. \n\nAccessing Spot is organized through the use of two parachains - the Robonomics and Statemine parachains. Logs of the students passing the course will be recorded on the Robonomics Parachain where the [Statemine parachain](https://polkadot.network/statemine-upgrade-launches-new-phase-of-parachain-functionality/) is being used to replace user accounts with unique access tokens that students will receive after payment of their course.\n\n## An Urban Sensor Network on the Volga river\n\nOne experiment that is leveraging the power of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/) based Blockchain technologies is currently taking place in Tolyatti. The focus here is creating an alarm network detecting high levels of air pollution without a commercial focus and being dependent on a government, but solely being supported by the citizens of Tolyatti and the Russian Airalab organization. The automatically collected information on exceeding the level of air pollution will be used for a quick response of the mobile laboratory, which is already capable of conducting a detailed analysis of particles in the air.\n\nAll data collected by the Urban Sensor Network will be securely recorded in the Robonomics parachain to avoid any possibility of intervention in the measurement history and provide security from disabling the network during attacks of the main server. \n\nIt is an example of the social impact the Robonomics project can have in these times where [90% of the world's population breathes dirty air](https://www.bloomberg.org/blog/accelerating-clean-air-action-one-data-point-at-a-time/). Thus, with the help of Kusama we can have a trustable, immutable way of storing pollution data which can be used for science to create a better world for all [protected against corrupted actors on both corporate and government level](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/06/05/corruption-is-a-threat-to-planet-earth/).\n\n<Card>\n\nWatch **a step-by-step process** of how to connect an SDS011 Air Quality Sensor to the Robonomics Decentalized Sensor Network from our Community member\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AQ7ZzgbN7jU\n\n</Card>\n\n## Digital Twins for Smart Leasing\n\nThere is an interesting new use case in Robonomics. For four months already, an industrial manipulator has been operating in a manufacturing facility in the United States with an hourly wage. At the end of each shift, the manipulator updates its digital twin instance stored in the parachain. Based on the changes in the digital twin, an invoice is issued for the use of the manipulator structured as IoT-enabled leasing. \n\nThus, we can say that Kusama will be an example of a fintech solution from web3 for the new industry 4.0. [Someday the public will understand the significance of this use case](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/manufacturing/us-supply-chain-of-the-autonomous-robots.pdf), and we will see a boom of DeFi for this modern industry!\n\n## Digital Passports for IoT systems\n\nTwo projects — one is from New Zealand — are using parachains for recording data about production manufacturing.

Each parachain that adds a Robobank branch to its runtime will be able to use the functions of launching a smart device running under the Robonomics parachain control.\n\n\nUsers will not have to pay commissions outside of the native parachain token  — any payment made through Robobank will provide a free execution of an automated service / launch of an IoT device for the user. The only thing that the owner of the automated service will need is an active subscription of the IoT device to use the Robonomics parachain.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## Polkadot for IoT.

This approach saves us from the fear of being in a cool but empty sandbox.\n\nThe presence of the Robonomics parachain will allow other Polkadot parachains to expand the functionality of native tokens by adding instead of the full and rather complex functionality of working with IoT devices to your virtual machine (i.e runtime), functions such as: pay for launching an IoT device or receive data from the device during the payment process.\n\nNext, we will look at an example of architecture using multiple Polkadot parachains in order to extend the capabilities of any project through infrastructure integration solutions based on XCMP.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## Robobank Architecture\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n![\"Robobank from Robonomics introduction, infographics\"](./images/robobank-introduction/robobank-introduction-infographics.png)\n\n</section>\n\nConsider an example of a truly decentralized Uber service.\n\nBy implementing Uber Parachain, developers could focus on the rating system of drivers, the system for processing user requests in p2p mode, and other customer service issues, and not worry about the need to simultaneously support the IoT component of their applications — Robonomics will help with IoT. Uber Parachain will only need to integrate the Robobank pallet into its runtime in order to provide customer access to the car after payment and receive trip reports directly from the IoT modules of the car.\n\n### Let's have a look at the diagram above and highlight the important points:\n\n* **Polkadot token** is a native parachain token, implemented for example through the assets pallet.\n* **Robonomics Web Services** is a pallet inside the Robonomics parachain, which implements the ability to connect an IoT device under the control of the Polkadot network on a monthly subscription model with guaranteed bandwidth.\n* **IoT app** is a custom application for automating the ordering of services, in which the native parachain token is used for payment. In the example with Uber Parachain, it would be a familiar phone application for city residents to order a taxi or search for a carsharing service.\n* **The car icon** is an IoT device acting as a party to an automated service, partially or completely providing a service. In the example, it would be a car, and by no means a driver! It is the car that would be the party providing access to opening the car doors and generating a trip report with telemetry data.\n* **Robobank Branch** is the Robonomics module for inclusion in the Polkadot parachain network.\n* **Robobank Tower** is the Robonomics module that runs permanently in the runtime of the Robonomics parachain and can launch IoT devices with an active subscription based on token transfer transactions in neighboring parachains.\n\nAs you can see from the diagram and the description of the modules, the parachains need to install Robobank Branch, which can be performed in the parachain [update mode](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-protocol-info#runtime-upgrades) without a hard fork.\n\nNow let's look at a step-by-step use case to represent the full cycle of the Robobank module after the Robobank Branch is enabled by the Polkadot parachain.\n\n1. `PaymentToRobot()` — this function can be seen among others in the parachain after the Robobank Branch module is enabled. As a result of a user sending a transaction from an IoT application, Robobank Branch will receive data on the amount of the payment and the device that needs to be launched for execution.\n2. `TransferToRobobank()` – will ensure the transfer of funds from the user account to the Robobank account with the ability to withdraw the accumulated amount in one transaction from the IoT device. For example, after making 10 trips or working within 5 hours, the car can generate automatic transactions to transfer funds from the Robobank account to the address of the crypto exchange. There is no actual movement of tokens from one parachain to another.\n3. `SignalToRobonomics()` — will be a function using XCMP. It is important to note that we will be able to ensure that messages sent on behalf of Robobank Branch are identified and marked as trusted. Some analogue of communication between smart contracts in the Ethereum network.\n4. `SignalFromRobonomicsBranch()`  — the message sent in the previous step will be sent through the Relay chain for processing to the central node of the Robobank Tower module. Having received a message from the parachain, Robobank Tower will record the request to launch the payment device in the Robonomics parachain, and thereby remove the need to store the payment log on the side of each parachain who uses the Robobank Branch module. In fact, the Robobank branches will perform the functions of correspondent accounts and are subordinate to the main branch in the form of a Tower, in which the full history of the execution of the automated service with payment in the neighboring parachain will be kept.\n5. `FreeTXtoRWS()` — two modules of the Robonomics parachain can trust each other, just like smart contracts in Ethereum. If we can ensure trust in the request from Robobank Branch to Robobank Tower, then in the same way we can provide the ability to launch a device with an active subscription not from the device address, but based on payment in tokens.\n6. `Launch || Datalog` — a combination of these functions will allow, for example, to launch a service for execution with an indication of the user who will have access to the back door of the car in the Uber Parachain application, or record the data necessary for the provision of the service.\n7. Steps 7-10 implement the possibility described in step 2. `TransferToRobobank()` to periodically empty your IoT device account by sending a transaction in the Robonomics parachain directly to Robobank Tower.\n\nAs a result, we examined the architecture of a solution using cross-chain transactions to expand the capabilities of a separate project at the expense of a common ecosystem.\n\n<section class=\"animate-inside\" v-in-viewport.once>\n\n## Current status and plans\n\n</section>\n\nAfter the first tests on the Rococo network, the developers will publish instructions for the implementation and use of the Rocobank module on the [wiki.robonomics.network](https://wiki.robonomics.network/)\n\nOur main goal is to prepare the Robobank module for the launch of parachains on the Kusama network in the summer of 2021.\n\nTo find out more, stay in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics).\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.62c183a.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.9ea8d39.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg 480w","/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.6b2ed88.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/robobank-introduction-cover.62c183a.4079e04ef9e4e1ca459e2146f896590e.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-cfe40197b020caf02faed6579c04cd73'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-cfe40197b020caf02faed6579c04cd73)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2b53ZmrUbtGwohs1/1iqx8WJVkP0HP8H%2bsXEJZI4HYBF/avf7VNA1peL%2bndDncboS50TbqrNahu0rQJhsxKVyVxlWU8EZB5OhDVud0LG89ablTqw1KNClVYiGJryOXkcJli3ocEYHwNzg6qezC9ezLBKAJInKNj6Dg6lgNoNnb4rXv8csuSucRh5wtK16fS0%2bNa0K1%2bzxpKrPnwVmwMnAz61c/ZrpXbd66QtXr1etLNFeaEGSukhx%2bNW5YH6fWg3uTJZ6f7p7s23WGgsVpk8JoAIjn8aHOFwBpKKkGNBKpIeN194yVIGdSfTm3jc96pbfI4jWaUR%2bSxhjk8AeuScDPAzn9tdu47/u3VW4VZN/3CzcPmsSiRyQoJ/YcakOttuWsqX45pBI74VFAVUBJOBgD7/WoGuIqBkuvKPdQfUFBNu3KSrCfJQikq4QtGxXJQsvolT6yP8ORqNVSDgD3o07a7XU3OHeJLsX5WrpCY8njyYg/5rvqdM1X7l7pti/jEFMWCqmPyUlIxg%2bOfpzj3xrO2ZrpTFuO3VI6MtjxNv3oq84049jPI%2b6Mk2WrBuvSU4UMu4WUE0TDKepVHHwg%2bxqe7s7dtUdi5apUBVnkWGziN8IofAKhQAP509wmvoha4OFQv//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Network 2020 Recap","path":"/blog/recap-2020/","date":"December 30, 2020","description":"Recap of the 2020 year in Robonomics: Blockchain development, Robonomics Web Services, Robotics, Sensors, Academia incentive program.
