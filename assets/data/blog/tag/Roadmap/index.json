In the coming months, the project R&D team will devote itself to integrations with the Statemine, Karura, Moonriver, Crust and KILT parachains.","content":"\n[Release 2.0](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v2.0.0) is a very important milestone for our project & community, as it opens up the possibility of integrating Robonomics with other parachains in the Kusama ecosystem. In the coming months, the project R&D team will devote itself to integrations with the Statemine, Karura, Moonriver, Crust and KILT parachains.\n\nWe took the first steps towards parachain communication 1.5 years ago, [demonstrating the exchange of messages between two blockchains](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/cross-chain-messages/) during a master class in St. Petersburg. Last year, [Gav published a series of articles in which XCMP was modified](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format-3b77b1373392) - it was turned into cross-consensus messaging (XCM) and received it’s first version number above zero.\n\nTwo months after the refactoring of XCM, the Robonomics team have now completed our tests on Rococo and we are ready to integrate with other parachains in the Kusama ecosystem.\n\n## Basic support for XCM in Robonomics\n\nAdhering to the view that Kusama itself is a heterogeneous network, the Robonomics developers are trying to implement IoT/Robotics-specific functionality into the Robonomics parachain code.\n\nWe will maximize our usage of the features from other parachains which can help to implement smart home/city or industrial scenarios when possible. For example, this year we plan to use the existing solutions of other parachains (not create our own solutions for): (1) personal balances of user access tokens, (2) dapp and IoT device user identification system, (3) large file storage, (4) use of IoT devices in work smart contracts.\n\nAt the time of the release of version 2.0, Robonomics is ready for integration with any parachain running on the Kusama network. The software implementation of XCM support can be found in [the alpha runtime directory](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/tree/master/runtime/alpha) of the main Robonomics repository on Substrate.\n\nIn May and June 2022, compatibility tests with the Relay chain were already carried out on Rococo network using the example of teleporting the native Rococo Relay Chain token - ROC (analogous to KSM, but on the Rococo test network) - to the Robonomics parachain.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BJHSFDZt0y4\n\n[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics/status/1534081132765097984)\n\nIf you have any ideas based on integrating Robonomics with other Kusama parachains, email research@robonomics.network or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/atduhWZpVr) for discussion in our main community channels.\n\n## Integration with Statemine\n\nThe main goal of our integration with Statemine is the full launch of the liability() function of the Robonomics parachain. The liability() function is quite similar to the main Robonomics function in Ethereum, which allows you to organize a full cycle - using a robot as a service. From the moment of integration with Statemine, developers of IoT applications will be able to create their own token in Statemine (or use any existing Statemine token) to launch a smart device/robot to execute a given program. After the user program is executed, the tokens will be automatically transferred to the balance of the robot.\n\nBack in spring, we showed a simple example of using tokens in Statemine to launch a coffee machine and described one of the scenarios of the tokenization development of access to equipment in the article: [Coworking for crypto-anarchists, p1](https://blog.aira.life/coworking-for-crypto-anarchists-p1-5ebecb252f2d). Accounting for the use of equipment in the office and differential distribution of access to equipment fits very well with access tokens in conjunction with the liability () function.\n\nAnother example of the use of Statemine integration with Robonomics, based on our existing use cases is the ability to use a telescope to mint NFT postcards. Today, user balances are stored in Statemine, and then NFTs are issued using RMRKs. Starting with our integration with Statemine, the telescope will be able to receive a task to create an image through the liability () function, and access tokens sent to the telescope will go to the balance of the telescope only after adding a link to NFT in the results of the liability () execution.\n\nWork status: Q3 2022\n\n## Integration with Karura\n\nAs long term builders on both the Ethereum and Dotsama ecosystems, Robonomics believes in integrating decentralized means of exchange for Robonomics parachain native token (XRT). Listing XRT on Karura swap is the ideal way to allow our token community to swap parachain native tokens in a decentralized way, and opening these HRMP communication channels is the first step in achieving that goal.\n\nOne of the ideas of Robonomics developers for further integration with Karura is automated currency and value exchange points for Kusama network tokens. We will share more about this separately, and certainly after the first step with the addition of XRT to Karura Swap.\n\nWork status: Q3 2022\n\n## Integration with Moonriver\n\nThe Robonomics parachain can become a universal mechanism for launching smart devices from within Moonriver smart contracts. We are currently working on this architecture and discussing a separate carbon footprint offset scenario using [DAO IPCI smart contracts](https://github.com/DAO-IPCI/DAO-IPCI) on the Moonriver parachain. \n\nWork status: Q3 2022\n\n## Integration with KILT\n\nOver the years of studying the robotics market, Robonomics developers have agreed that device identification is one of the most important tasks when considering complex scenarios for automating city life, logistics and industrial supply chains. KILT is an excellent example of continuing work towards integrating the functionality of various parachains within a heterogeneous network and solving problems that are significant for the IoT market.\n\nWork status: Q4 2022\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.1ffc44b851d313c35c5fe267555bfa2d.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.1ffc44b851d313c35c5fe267555bfa2d.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.1ffc44b851d313c35c5fe267555bfa2d.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.1ffc44b851d313c35c5fe267555bfa2d.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-335b1a1637208f41e97129a1fc282bcc'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-335b1a1637208f41e97129a1fc282bcc)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUABgEDBwj/xAAvEAABAwMCBQMDAwUAAAAAAAABAgMEAAUREiETIjFBUQZhkRQycQdSsSNCgaHR/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwEC/8QAIxEAAgICAQIHAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAEQMhMRIiMlFhgZHh8P/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A8%2bVmsVcPQXolfq5ma4i5MwvploQQtvWVagTn7hgDFNCVSxoSuWm1XC8S/pbTBkzZOkq4UdsrVgdTgUKhBUsJwR526ea6jGiQ/wBL/UymrxcJc6PLiaii3ANlZQ%2bCELJVlIJbyFpIUk4I7g87hyWmZQklKXP6hXw3STtnIycb79fx71UAY0TQmcnUoNCzAnUaFkDJHYkYyKnCcwo6F4SApXKdgehPtTO/3AXefInFplh15WtSGQdJUfuI8ZPNjyT5qPTUzIxiobe4iuFo0f3qSnTpIHUeD1qZO062I2DGrqS5ojj10fr5impR6bPc1loN2%2bWsukpb0tKOsjqBjqRih5USRELYlMOMlxOtGtONSc4yPIyD8VLhzR%2belXL1jcbHcrPBbt1thRJEdWkuRxgrQU5AUDud%2b5zvmqd2ouKwhbPMM61BAP7Sd8/66e9G%2bFHZXbleNn8feaQt4QeYVZYDEh5GtzhtblxwJyGxg7q6d9PzT1d8YVGEhyYyu4KQkLaRb06Ac8wznGAMkEDc/NIbu6Q45Da5I8denT%2b9XdR8n%2bKEiOIacDjjQdCTsgnAP59qSriJRIF0JZpUiyS55eeuz%2btakEqTbsIASTjlz87b0rlp%2bglInQHXBoWHGJCQOZYwdgM4OdXX4oWbJVKlqcUlKUpwhCEDCUJ7ACtNumLiOdNbLhCXGicBY/74PaoEANzWVVRiAbHnVRiPUt3bab4VyeQEnlQkJAQc5OkAYSPYYpRKkvS3eJJdU65vzK69Sf5JP%2baYXWGiKp1lJyGnCgHGM7E5Pk0prUFgRP/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics parachain updates, March’22","path":"/blog/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/","date":"March 17, 2022","description":"The Robonomics parachain was launched in January of this year, and our first publicly available progress report was published on January 18th in a blog post. Now, we will provide details of the work we have already performed within the task list","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\nimport UserForm from '~/components/blocks/UserForm.vue'\n\nThe Robonomics parachain was launched in January of this year, and our first publicly available progress report was published on January 18th [in a blog post](https://robonomics.network/blog/parachain-on-kusama-first-week-report/). Now, we will provide details of the work we have already performed within the task list as specified in the roadmap on Github: [Tracking issue for Robonomics Parachains on Kusama Launch #145](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/issues/145).\n\n## About the most important things in the work of the Robonomics parachain on Kusama in 2 months\n\n- The parachain is stable and has processed the first million extrinsics. The current network of collators also remains open with approximately [80 collators](https://telemetry.parachain.robonomics.network/#list/Robonomics). Anyone can [become a Robonomics collator](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/how-to-launch-the-robonomics-collator/) and receive rewards for preparing parachain block candidates and passing them to the Kusama validators.\n\n- [In the release 1.8.2](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.8.2), the sudo function was removed. The change was accepted by the parachain at the block [347,918](https://robonomics.subscan.io/block/347918). This means that the project development team no longer has the administrative functions of managing the parachain anymore.\n\n- [The technical committee](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/techcomm) completed the first update of the network protocol through the on-chain governance mechanism. In just 2 months, the technical committee has processed around 40 requests, such as exodus events, treasury proposals and runtime upgrades.\n\n- [Starting from the release 1.8.0](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.8.0), the Robot-as-a-service function is fully available. Using this function, you can combine the technical and economic parameters of launching an IoT device.\n\n- [The mechanism of IoT subscriptions in the Robonomics parachain](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/get-subscription/) has passed the stage of the first applications in real work scenarios. Now it has become the main functionality of the parachain, which the Robonomics developers plan to offer to home infrastructure owners.\n\n- The Winter school was suspended on February 24th. After 3 weeks, the developers decided to abandon the continuation of the school as an event. The Winter School lessons have been redesigned as an introductory Robonomics course, which will be available online 24/7 during 2022 from anywhere in the world. The course will be published on the [robonomics.academy website](https://robonomics.academy/) by the end of March.\n\n- An additional 1 XRT for crowdoan campaign participants who have a pioneer card [is available through the Robonomics dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/bonus-for-pioneer).\n\n## Parachain statistics for 2 months\n\nYou can find most of the statistics yourself on the Subscan.io block explorer at: [robonomics.subscan.io](https://robonomics.subscan.io)\n\n![Parachain statistics on Subscan.io](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/robonomics-parachain-subscan.jpg)\n\n### The Robonomics parachain processed 1 million transactions\n\nIt is more correct to say [extrinsics](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-protocol-info#extrinsics), but still we will sometimes use such assumptions for simplicity.\n\n![extrinsics for Robonomics](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/montly-extrinsics.png)\n\nThe daily load on the parachain today is from 10 to 25 thousands transactions per day. The datalog() function is mainly used to remotely collect data from IoT devices. Also, since February, the Robonomics developers have started using parachain IoT subscriptions for the first Robonomics scenarios of which we have been preparing for the past 2 years.\n\n![The daily load on the parachain today](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/robonomics-parachain-transactions.jpg)\n\nThe number of full Robonomics nodes that transmit to [the publicly available parachain telemetry service](https://telemetry.parachain.robonomics.network/#list/Robonomics) has doubled from 40 to 80 full network nodes. Anyone can [become a Robonomics collator](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/how-to-launch-the-robonomics-collator/) and receive rewards for preparing parachain block candidates and passing them to the Kusama validators.\n\n### The first Robonomics users\n\nAlready in early February, we had confidence that the Robonomics parachain was ready to accept it’s first users. Engaging early adopters always involves putting a lot of emphasis on training and helping out with whatever situation an early version user gets into. It is also a search for the most patient and responsive people who are interested in the technologies we use. Yes, there are always a few of them, and it is difficult to find them in more numbers than a couple of friends and work colleagues, but this is precisely the task we face in 2022. By creating a community of web3 + IoT power users ready to experiment for the sake of education, we will be able to ensure the exponential growth of the project in 2023-2024.\n\nThe main thing we want to do to attract the first users is to develop some training courses in 2022 that will not only be useful in terms of acquiring skills, but will also be interesting to complete.\n\nOf course, the Robonomics developers plan to organize contests and encourage the community for being active. However, we still believe that creativity/enthusiasm is stronger than the learning material we could provide. It's cool when, in the process of learning, you can try [to go through a black mirror](https://blackmirror.robonomics.academy/#/) and, while the QR code on the screen changes, remember any episode of the series of the same name or a scene from Philip K. Dick's book \"Ubik\", in which the main character quarrels with the door, to which he owes a couple of coins... In general, one of the main tasks of the team is to maintain a creative approach to user education in the future.\n\n![](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/blackmirror-lesson.jpg)\n\nThe Winter school [was suspended on February 24th](https://twitter.com/EnsRationis/status/1496885398404059136). Fortunately, you can still try the first lesson now! To do this, follow the link: [https://blackmirror.robonomics.academy/#/](https://blackmirror.robonomics.academy/#/)\n\nThose who have already completed the first lesson of the School in February may notice that the address of (D)app has changed. Now the lesson is available on the robonomics.academy domain, and soon all 5 lessons that we planned to conduct in the event format of the last week of February will be available online 24/7 in the Robonomics introductory course format. We will tell you about this separately.\n\n### The Robonomics releases on GitHub\n\nOver the past 2 weeks, there have been many releases of the Robonomics parachain client. The most relevant at the time of this writing is [1.8.4](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases).\n\n[Building the Robonomics parachain client](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/how-to-build-collator-node/) on Ubuntu 21.10 and running without any difficulties:\n\n![Building the Robonomics parachain client](./images/robonomics-parachain-updates-march-22/building-client-for-robonomics-parachain.jpg)\n\nIn addition to system updates in releases, it is important to note the following improvements:\n\n- [Release 1.8.0](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.8.0) - added pallet liability, which allows you to fully implement the Robot-as-a-Service model and launch an IoT device with the transfer of technical and economic information in an atomic form.\n- [Release 1.8.2](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v1.8.2) - the superuser (sudo) has been removed from the Robonomics parachain. Already today, the Robonomics parachain does not have the possibility of direct control by the developers.\n\nYou can get acquainted with all the changes in the Robonomics parachain client at the link: [https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases)\n\n## The first stage of the roadmap 2022 is 90% completed\n\nBy the end of Q1 2022, the project team has completed almost all [the tasks to implement the basic functionality of the parachain](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/issues/145), and several Robonomics scenarios that previously worked only in test mode are already at the pilot stage.\n\n### The main task of Q2 2022 - XCM integrations\n\nAs you can see from [the Tracking issue for Robonomics Parachains on Kusama Launch #145](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/issues/145), the first part of the tasks has an item related to [XCMP](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/XCMP/index.html) implementation. We implemented the first tests with messaging between 2 instances of the Robonomics parachain during [a master class in St. Petersburg in the fall of 2020](https://youtu.be/zCH7RuIHEMg). It is the case howeever, that in past 1.5 years XCMP has undergone many changes, and now it is more correct to say [XCM (Cross-Consensus Message)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain).\n\nGavin Wood introduced the first version of XCM in the fall of 2021. XCM is well covered in three articles on medium:\n\n- [XCM: The Cross-Consensus Message Format](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format-3b77b1373392)\n- [XCM Part II: Versioning and Compatibility](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-part-ii-versioning-and-compatibility-b313fc257b83)\n- [XCM Part III: Execution and Error Management](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-part-iii-execution-and-error-management-ceb8155dd166)r\n\nAlready in February, we began to refine the Robonomics parachain in order to implement the first integration within the Kusama ecosystem. Our first task in this direction is integration with the Statemine parachain. This integration will allow users to use any statemine tokens to pay according to the Robot-as-a-Service model, for example, [when remotely controlling a telescope in the Atacama Desert](http://telescope.merklebot.com/) or to pay for items in a vending machine with tokens anywhere in the world.\n\nIn addition to integration with Statemine, plans for Q2 include:\n\n- Integration with Karura to add XRT/kUSD liquidity pool.\n- Integration with Moonriver to manage IoT devices using arbitrary solidity contracts.\n- Studying the technology of bridges between Ethereum and Kusama using the example of Darwinia.\n\nWe will describe each integration scenario separately based on the results of testing in Rococo, Westend or other sandboxes where Karura, Moonriver, Darwinia parachains have their own test versions.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nThere is complete chaos around us now, but the project team marked our trajectory for the web3 universe long ago - we publish the results of our work on the Internet so that experiments can be repeated anywhere in the world, because apart from open source code and access to the blockchain, you do not need anything more. Of course, life in the world of web3 is not so easy when it comes to a lot of details, but we can handle it. As engineers, we can imagine the consequences of militarization in the 21st century. The best thing that we all can do, with the current geopolitcal situations in mind, is to personally participate in peaceful projects and create as much open source software as possible for the tasks of ordinary people. Over the past year, our efforts have launched such projects as: an educational program for [remote control of the robotic dog Boston Dynamics](https://spot-sdk.education/); [remote observation of the starry sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up8hESnXnaY) from the most suitable place for this on the planet Earth - the Atacama Desert; [civil sensor network for monitoring the quality of the urban environment](https://airalab.org/en/air-monitoring) in the industrial city of Togliatti; [monitoring of water quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iCkdF2UJmo) in the canals of St. Petersburg. This year we will be focusing on smart home scenarios so you can [manage your home IoT infrastructure without the help of clouds](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/home-assistant-begin/).\n\nWe will share more with you in the next roadmap updates.","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.2dda027cdaaedf053f61bff5d81e8041.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.2dda027cdaaedf053f61bff5d81e8041.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.2dda027cdaaedf053f61bff5d81e8041.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.2dda027cdaaedf053f61bff5d81e8041.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-9c72c2939326f9be396c478461340868'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-9c72c2939326f9be396c478461340868)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMBBAUAB//EAC4QAAICAQMDAQYGAwAAAAAAAAECAxEABBIhBTFRQQYiIzJhcRMUgZGh0TOx8P/EABgBAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDAgAE/8QAIBEAAgIBBAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECESEEEjFBA2GRgf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A8JCadzt3sG8uK/nEaiFoWpu2N72aokd8bFKn5e5IxKI22gPYBvtdfrlhcFw2H0fous6o/wABNsINGV%2bFH28n7YnqWli0/UZNNppWmVG2lytWfWs0tDr%2bsdRaTp%2bjDSXGaigATYq%2bo%2bnnGaT2a9oNOyzxdK1AdGBDnb7vqOD%2b95pbbyX1UtLHwKGmi3PtvH4krx3eWYM0LxahoWVldW2kMKIN1RHocZLpwke5WJ4sWKDC64zYm6f13rTnqZ0c2plmbcZhtuQjgmuL7cnKPUI9VpmMOrii08kih%2bTZZSTRFX4wlV4PDFN8mZnZLCj3B%2b2RgJYLBQfJ%2buOcfgaQq3DsbIPcccA/Wuf1w3ZY03xxorVww5I%2b13lOfvR5Y8lj3OcUci5EkSgHYA1gXukXuB61/wB%2b2SyfNbk%2bFLS2B47ZWXV0BcYNMGHvt6CvP0wz1C7%2bEbPH%2bZ/7yEozvF/SDTsYqKkQXdb%2bQ0g2jv2rtkypEsbuyiWuR78nA8cjErrwOHhLmqJMr/3gjWUtOhda2lTI1H%2bcNs/f0KYhyGdiq7VJ4W7rBw5HV2tECCvlBJ/3gZdcGz//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Trajectory 2022: Heading for Product Launches","path":"/blog/trajectory-2022-heading-for-product-launches/","date":"December 31, 2021","description":"The year 2021 ends and with it a 4-year cycle of studying the Polkadot technology and R&D work on the implementation of the Robonomics parachain.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\nThe year 2021 ends and with it a 4-year cycle of studying the Polkadot technology and R&D work on the implementation of the Robonomics para chain. We want to devote the next year to the development of Robonomics as an already working infrastructure, focusing on the most viable web3 application scenarios in the area of the Internet of Things. In this context, the key thing is that we have the relevant experience and a team willing to devote their time to research development and more. \n\nNext, I will try to tell you about the products that we plan to release so as to provide Robonomics users with web3 application scenarios for IoT, which are useful in everyday life.\n\n## Kusama – a network for connecting personal IoT infrastructure and start-up projects; Polkadot – for corporate\n\nThis is how we imagine the development of Robonomics as a parachain. We want to start by implementing on the Kusama network, which features enough cybersecurity to service home robotics but is not suitable for big corporate accounts. In the context of B2B applications, Kusama is only suitable for start-up projects. And this would be so, at least until each release in Kusama is accompanied by an independent audit of the code and other components that are important for integration into the business processes of large companies.\n\n![\"Kusama and Polkadot plans\"](./images/trajectory-2022-heading-for-product-launches/Kusama_Polkadot.jpg)\n\nThus, users of Robonomics 2022 are the owners of home IoT infrastructure and start-up projects, which are interested in the possibilities of web3, and they are ready to trust something new :) \n\nFurther information on our plans for this user category, next year.\n\n## RWS: Robonomics for your smart home\n\nDuring 2020, a basic architecture was developed for representing the parachain as a familiar cloud for IoT devices. Moving forward, part of the future infrastructure of Robonomics in a parachain format, will be called RWS.\n\nIn 2021, numerous [experiments were conducted to connect popular smart home solutions to RWS services](https://youtu.be/H-w2FX-zd0M). Developers are now ready to provide a monthly subscription service for those who already use a home IoT infrastructure and would like to try web3-based services. \n\nSome of the specific actions we have completed, to connect a smart home controlled by the Kusama network, are as follows:\n\n* Completed the initial connection with [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant), the most famous opensource solution in the field of smart home control, and will continue to develop this area to decouple the existing IoT hubs in homes from cloud services;\n* Started the release and global distribution of the first IoT hub, which will be [compatible with sensors operating under the Zigbee protocol](https://www.amazon.com/zigbee-sensor/s?k=zigbee+sensor) in the spring of 2022;\n* Continuation of the [series of publications and instructions](https://blog.aira.life/coworking-for-crypto-anarchists-p1-5ebecb252f2d) on how to organise space in a team without the tyranny of the administrator, but only with a light electric shock from Rosie's home robot.\n\nBesides providing control via the Kusama network, we want to allow everyone who cares about the word “dapp” to try Robonomics applications.\n\n## Robonomics-based applications for end users\n\nOver 50 people have participated in R&D projects based on Robonomics over the past 5 years. As a result, we can see the emergence of teams specialising in specific applications, which are ready to offer users a product or service.\n\nIn fact, this evolution arises from the growth of the R&D team: from a team that exclusively publishes reports and instructions from specialists, into a whole ecosystem of teams that have specialized for specific scenarios while helping to write different pieces of the software platform. Today, the platform already has more than ten commonly used repositories for specific types of dapps, IoT connectivity, or building more complicated things. Below are some of them, or rather some of Robonomics' applications that are now turning into separate start-up projects with the developers' participation.\n\n### The Robodog is used not only for training but also for inspiration\n\nThe remote training programme for working with BD Spot is moving towards certification of specialists, with the issuance of diplomas of additional education in a university format and building corporate training programs, which, I think, will be implemented over the next year. This area is nonetheless extremely closed, like a school of magic in any fantasy universe. But the Robodog has another interesting feature: due to its popularity in society, Spot can be useful in simpler scenarios, for example, feeling like a robot operator from the future. During 2022, we want to create a separate opportunity to rent a Spot unit and a track. With that, we'll open a portal to a world of inspiration for children who cannot play football or conduct other physical activity. After all, imagine how abruptly your view of what you can do will change after controlling a Robodog for an hour. We will attempt to launch such a programme together with a charitable foundation to help those children who are already struggling in a challenging developmental stage to pursue a future career in robotics.\n\n### Vegan techie\n\nI rarely admit it but I have been a vegetarian for over 7 years – although I try to stay away from meetings with other vegetarians :) Perhaps this is specific to Russia, but looking at the interests of vegetarians, I notice with apprehension the tendencies towards a \"back-to-the-middle-ages\" lifestyle, i.e., natural resources grown by yourself, no waste – because you eat only vegetables... Needless to say, saving the Earth from our ignorance is necessary. And yet, I believe more in robots and their work as guards of the goddess Gaia than in any eco-trends. \n\nTo support those aiming to live in harmony with nature while adhering to the principle \"it is a machine, not a person\", we are launching a project to automatically offset the carbon footprint of electricity anywhere in the world. Buy a smart socket for your home, connect to Robonomics, and install a bundle with the DAO IPCI application in the [Robonomics marketplace](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services). Thus, your smart home will autonomously consider the monthly power consumption and compensate for the environmental damage caused by the generation of this electricity by donating small cryptocurrency amount. \n\nTo realise this scenario, the company Evercity helped acquire the carbon credits of two verified projects, which are traded on a European exchange. There is one additional launch. This service will be launched in February-March 2022.\n\n### The first civilian sensor network in Russia using IPFS and Substrate Blockchain\n\nFor the third year in a row, the city of Tolyatti – incidentally where many project participants were born – has been experimenting with building urban monitoring using autonomous IoT sensors. In 2021, over 25 sensors throughout the city sent data to Robonomics, and a monitoring map was created in dapp format. Dozens of public ecologists have regularly worked with the map since the summer of 2021.\n\nFind out more on the [website](https://airalab.org/en/) of the non-profit organisation Airalab Rus, Tolyatti.\n\nBy the way, the touch map is globally available– feel free to connect as tens of those interested have already done. Here's a sample video from the community:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AQ7ZzgbN7jU\n\n### Feecc - quality control system for small factories\n\nA student group from ITMO together with LLC \"Multi-agent systems\" created and tested a quality control system at two enterprises that can be easily integrated into an assembler's workplace or into an element of a conveyor line. The system will be offered at a low price and features a high data protection level.\n\nThe Feecc hardware and software complex will be available for purchase in 2022 at https://multi-agent.io/\n\n### A portal from the metaverse to the real world\n\nMerklebot's product team is preparing to launch an integration with Chilean telescopes designed for deep-space photography. The telescope will be controlled with the help of the Robonomics' dapp. Moreover, you will be able to take a picture of the sky and send a friend a “Hello from Alpha Centauri” NFT postcard!\n\n![\"NFT from online telescope\"](./images/trajectory-2022-heading-for-product-launches/NFT.jpg)\n\n## Annex 1: contacting with the community\n\nThroughout the year the Robonomics custdev team conducted interviews with developers, professionals and experts from the fields of robotics, engineering, IoT and cloud technologies to get their point of view on web3, distributed technologies and understand the problems they face when developing software applications and technical solutions. We also collected feedback about Robonomics, and in which use cases our platform could be useful in the opinion of the respondents. Below we would like to share our findings based on these interviews.\n\n**Statistics by respondents:**\n\n* Total interviews: 156 respondents\n* Geography: European countries (36%), India (22%), USA (19%), other countries (23%)\n* Areas of activity: ROS developers, robotics engineers, IoT engineers, startup founders, students and professors: Computer science, Robotics, Mechanical Engineering\n\nIn general, robotic and IoT software developers still vaguely understand the concept of web3, or know about it, but do not use these technologies in their professional work. For some respondents, the idea of using blockchain and smart contracts to securely manage a network of devices was quite a surprise. Nevertheless, discussing the general problems of robotics, many developers have come to the same conclusions that we have come to: for the full-scale implementation of robotic devices in the future, the question of their reliable authentication will inevitably arise. Web3 technologies can be a possible solution, which, moreover, will make it possible to democratize and decentralize access to robots for all of humanity.\n\nOverall, the responses highlight the idea that the manufacturing industry wants to change its old business model, but does not yet know how to do it painlessly. Several specialists from B2B industries in interviews noted that large companies, on the one hand, are worried about the reliability of IoT connectivity through conventional networks, but on the other hand, they are not yet ready for web3 solutions as an alternative. The respondents were advised to demonstrate streamlined use cases that provide more profitable and less costly security than current, centralized solutions. A niche is open here for solutions like Robonomics, and according to one respondent, the motto “be robotically capable, but human readable” is a good approach to disseminate our ideas. The main obstacle was most often called the legal nuances of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, as well as the fact that we propose to preserve the confidentiality of data sent by user devices, which may contradict the business models of some companies.\n\nAmong the most frequent mentions in the stories of respondents was the problem of the high cost and complexity of deploying robotic solutions. Our common conclusion with the respondents was that the application of the concept of “robot-as-a-service” and smart leasing can make IoT and robots more accessible. \n\nAmong the use cases, for which, according to the respondents, the use of Robonomics is most attractive, scenarios with a public network (traffic management, environmental management), production / collection  / storage of environmental data, IoT solutions for small businesses, creation of digital twins were named.\n\nNext, we would like to introduce some of the noticeable respondents and their interesting stories.\n\n<Card>\n\n### [Kapil Deshpande](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kapil-deshpande-041193/)\n\n**Occupation:** Robotics Software Developer (ROS); **Experience:** ROS, Azure.\n\nDuring an interview with Kapil, it turned out that we came to the same ideas in different ways. While participating in Azure Hackathon, Kapil and his colleagues decided to develop a robot-as-a-service system for business based on blockchain and ROS — similar to Robonomics core elements at the beginning. Kapil believes that the cost of the robot's work to the final product price can be accurately calculated using smart contracts that link economic and technical information. Both us and he were very amused to hear our common ideas, conveyed in other words, independently of each other. As a result of his acquaintance with Robonomics, Kapil decided to apply for our grant program and take courses at the Robonomics Academy.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### [Houman Masnavi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/houman-masnavi/)\n\n**Occupation:** Software Developer; **Experience:** ROS with different robots — PAL Robotics TIAGo, KUKA youBot, MiR100, UR5, Jackal UGV, Turtlebot3, Parrot Bebop2.\n\nThe interview with Houman is a case where an engineer deeply immersed in robotics, mentioned in [the article](https://blog.ut.ee/robotics-wizard/) as a “robotics wizard”, became interested in the possibility of using web3 for robots. After several interviews, Houman became so interested in our project that he has become a full-fledged Robonomics tutor. He is currently supervising our wiki with meaningful comments on its structure and reviewing the quality of guides and video tutorials. \n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### [Primož Zajec](https://www.linkedin.com/in/primo%C5%BE-zajec-436099a6/)\n\n**Occupation:** Software Developer for Architectural Design of IoT and Industrial Systems; **Experience:** R&D development for IoT.\n\nPrimož learned about Robonomics by reading our R&D book. He was amazed by the platform and in the interview provided insightful feedback on Robonomics. Concluded that in his opinion “there is a market for Robonomics for sure”. Then he pitched Robonomics as a solution to the projects he thought the platform would fit into.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### [Dawit Legese](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawitlegese)\n\n**Occupation:** Java Developer; **Experience:** Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science.\n\nPrior to his role as a Java developer, Dawit worked on a humanoid robot project in which he and his colleagues attempted to integrate a controller into robots so that multiple robots could play soccer. For the data management of these robots, Dawit and his team were solely focused on interacting with live time data feeds as opposed to cloud data storage. Since most of the budget was spent on purchasing robots, Dawit had to take a much greater risk in conducting the experiment, because robots were the cheapest and a computer for processing live data was the simplest. Having learned about the smart leasing model that Robonomics allows to implement, Dawit became extremely interested in it.\n\n</Card>\n\n## Annex 2: Robonomics grant program: results of the year\n\nIn May 2021, Robonomics opened its own [grant program](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-program) to support students, young scientists and academic professionals in fields of cyber-physical systems, Industry 4.0 and IoT. The grant program has already successfully completed one round of proposals, and the second phase is now actively underway. On the eve of the new year, we would like to review the results of the outgoing one, talk about the success of old projects and the launch of new ones.\n\nThe stats for grant proposals are as follows:\n\n* Forks of the grant repository — 12\n* Submitted proposals — 6\n* Approved proposals — 3\n\nAs we noted in [the first round report](https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-grant-program-the-first-round-is-completed-the-second-round-is-ahead-7ff1dfb80722), we began to select projects more carefully, giving preference to applicants from the research and academic community. Therefore, the latest proposals come from students and professors of European universities, and in many cases, an important result of the project would be the publication in high-quality scientific journals and presentations at scientific conferences.\n\nNow let's take a look at the status of already launched projects (detailed results are available in [this repository](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-results)), and then discuss new proposals.\n\n### Progress of launched projects\n\n<Card>\n\n#### [Robossembler](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-program/blob/main/proposals/robossembler.md)\n\nSince April 2021, the team of the very first approved project has been creating a simulation model of a smart factory with a digital twin, which is able to create almost complete copies of itself. For 9 months of active work, the participants conducted a [voluminous study](https://robosphere.gitlab.io/robossembler-docs/docs/) on the principles of building self-replicated automatic systems that would be quite simple to implement. As a result, the basis of the production cell is a workplace in the form of a honeycomb with a 6-DOF manipulator, to which a set of various tools and machines can be connected (from soldering and welding to CNC machine and 3D printer). For each element of the production system, a STEP model [was created](https://gitlab.com/robosphere) that can simulate the operation of these nodes.\n\nThe Robossembler team tried several frameworks for simulation and so far they use a bundle of ROS2 + Unity for multi-agent scenarios and ROS2 + Ignition Gazebo simulator for modeling small manipulation tasks. ROS2-tools PlanSys2 and MoveIt2 are used as a system for planning actions and interactions of many participating devices. The team continues to work on the architecture for integrating Robonomics and recently submitted an article to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society journal about the concept of transferring skills and assembly programs between devices to launch new products.\n\n![\"Modular workspace for scalability of the production system\"](./images/trajectory-2022-heading-for-product-launches/Robossembler.png)\n\n*Modular workspace for scalability of the production system*\n\nThe team publishes all the results and everyone can try to test some of the modules of the factory. It is noteworthy that the team develops all the elements based on realistic prototypes, and provides the real design documentation for them. Who knows, maybe the next step after the simulation is to build a real self-replicating factory...\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n#### [AgriDataTrade](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-program/blob/main/proposals/agridatatrade.md)\n\nA team from New Zealand is working to create a system that facilitates environmental regulation of the use of farm areas. For this purpose, the AgriDataTrade project organizes on farms a secure automated collection of various data on soil conditions (nitrates, phosphates, greenhouse gases, etc.), in order to then launch data tokenization. Ultimately, this will create a soil credit market similar to the carbon credit one.\n\nThe AgriDataTrade project was launched 4 months ago and during this period the team received the necessary sets of sensors (Hach sensors capable of measuring pH, nitrates, conductivity and other indicators) and agreed with several farms on their placement. To connect the sensors, an Arduino board is used, which, using the local mobile network via the MQTT protocol (see [repository](https://github.com/AgriData-Trade/robonomics_mqtt)), connects to a remote server that creates nodes for these sensors in Robonomics Network. The team has already deployed a server at Victoria University of Wellington and will launch a test network of sensors on one of the farms in a few weeks.\n\n![\"The test map on which the data from the sensors will be displayed\"](./images/trajectory-2022-heading-for-product-launches/AgriDataTrade.png)\n\n*The test map on which the data from the sensors will be displayed*\n\n</Card>\n\n### New projects\n\n<Card>\n\n#### [LogisticsBDT](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-program/blob/main/proposals/LogisticsBDT.md)\n\nThe latest project approved by the grant program is the Logistics Blockchain Digital Twin, proposed by a team of researchers from the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria and Tallinn University of Technology. The project aims at identifying counterfeit products and verifying the authenticity of products in high-value supply chains. This is a serious problem both for the users of the products and for the manufacturers themselves (for example, in the heavy industry, automotive, aviation, pharmaceuticals), as it creates additional economic and legal burdens in the control of the chain.\n\nThe researchers propose a system based on digital twins of products using IoT sensors (for example, RFID tags) and the Robonomics Network, which would guarantee the observance of authenticity and the transfer of rights. To test the capabilities of such a system, applicants intend to create a realistic simulation of such a supply chain, which will be managed by a control system based on sensors and Robonomics.\n\nBased on the results of the project, the authors are going to develop a specification for the use of blockchain systems and IoT in high-value supply chains and publish a number of articles on this topic.\n\n![\"Authentication system architecture\"](./images/trajectory-2022-heading-for-product-launches/LogisticsBDT.png)\n\n*Authentication system architecture*\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n#### [Location Based Identities in Industry 4.0 Production](https://github.com/SaschaKaven/robonomics-grant-program/blob/main/proposals/sensorchain_security_%20interface.md)\n\nThis project is still undergoing approval at the Robonomics DAO, but we would like to present it now, since it touches on the topic of the previous one. Researchers from Hamburg University of Applied Sciences also aim at ensuring the authenticity and integrity of product data during the manufacturing process, for which they propose to create digital identities of objects by data blockchainzation of various sensors (researchers call this mechanism as sensorchain). The team similarly proposes to use RFID tags for this, and provide identification of devices by mapping with the location of these devices (proof-of-location). Robonomics is used to create and store digital twins of products and sensors.\n\nBut in the project, the authors want to go further and assemble a test bench based on the Fischertechnik constructor, which will simulate a factory and on which all developments will be tested. This makes the project very interesting, since, firstly, Robonomics has [a similar factory](https://youtu.be/LjIB3-4kQ0A) built from such a constructor, and secondly, the development of the LogisticsBDT project can be quite simply synergized with this test bench to get additional results. So let's wish the team good luck!\n\nIt has been a productive year for Robonomics-based R&D projects and we hope the next one will be even more eventful.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :icon=\"'/icons/icon-notification.png'\" :link=\"'https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics'\">\n\n### Join our Twitter\n\nStay tuned and follow updates\n\n</Card>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/cover.62c183a.2a9dcd2570bd1840ee35e163c6e4a64b.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/cover.9ea8d39.2a9dcd2570bd1840ee35e163c6e4a64b.jpg 480w","/assets/static/cover.6b2ed88.2a9dcd2570bd1840ee35e163c6e4a64b.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/cover.62c183a.2a9dcd2570bd1840ee35e163c6e4a64b.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-522ebc7a7465779872e214897aace1b3'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-522ebc7a7465779872e214897aace1b3)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAgIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAABAYFCAEHCQID/8QALxAAAgECBQIFAwMFAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEABQYSIRMxBxRBUWEjcYEiMkKRoeHw8f/EABgBAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDBAIF/8QAJREAAQQBAgYDAQAAAAAAAAAAAQACESEDEjEEE0FRYXEigaHB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwCtdMGlfbGNze1%2b/wAD5wfmVHUZZVNS10fSnVQxUkHgi47Y2h4V6P8ALaThz7M5ZpqLNJHSOmjTbDGYn2iSeax2HdcKoFzfuL4nvGXTmQTU/WELw6liy5VFNGz2klG3nYbkDZfbdu1hY4eMhJhon0PSpPDu5fNNDvIWgZHBxiliapqY4kBJYgWHfHimj6sqdcvFASVMmwm1h/z%2buJKmjWjLNBWxM4O7esbh1sCRbtx/jB1A7qYzFIfMsvqKLNJ6KSCWOaNyvScfrUg9j8jsftg2PLoIKbdPMs1TJdY4Y34B%2bT8YEq6iStkfzU5eTqECVgxdxYAckniwHHxgeHdBMjfUEYIJO23B7/2JGDsnYMjGn5Nk/gUhQQIK%2bkFRG1TTvIFZad7M/uoNuDyPTDnrTSWU5Bl7zwVlY0zOEhR%2bmUY8FhcG/AJPIHp74T6HzWZZrTQ5TTNLUtL1I4UBYs97/nsMGahz3Oswmmps9lleeKVt6TAho3vyLfx9eAMHVdLOQNDiGmlsyk01No2GE5zl1SWlvL0pa1ugVIJBaFB6he5J%2bQMMes462r0dFqKuigq4q9UEv1Te0ikEXHItwPxizs%2bS0k2cLmToDN5dqZlIBV0JvYi3%2b3whV2h8sfU1bTGKHyUtPvgpxEAlM9rblF7XFjbgWvirBxLAI2q/K578Dnm7PS4hU811kuZZTqvZlsbv5mOGpUUaFgJHTcV4H7rq1x8H2wu1y59Rxg1sFdTRpwOpCUVbg8cj2vjoNPoTKZ9MUuR1ivUUsbXclijSE7ib7SPVjx%2bPU4y%2bgshlq5Hq8vpZ45qZqUxtHwqFAjBeeNy3BPe1ueMc3NkccpLI0z9qzHAYA7dc%2bMtp8zzsT9F%2boKcddi7W54UAfJ7AffExrfR%2bd6UaBc4aBlnhSZdkqswU8C4HY3BHti7EXgroCCuNXTaehhmMgkOyWTbwwNtpawU2sQBaxI9cR9b4IaWzOdpa/wA3UG0ygPJcBXQqoAPA6dyV9icCTJTi5nLAbOq57eI/u/RUi0688VetTRSSR1VPaSN422lDe27d6WuPuSMfPNJ6qbMqqXMZJJatpC0zyG7MxPJJ%2bb4uivgFopq6SGKCqp4I7S7YZirMxYkXbvtXbwPk3J4sy5B4ZaWy2Ouy05XT1VMYYoQahN79IFmCMx/dZixDHnkD%2bIxrVcpK/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Robonomics Frontier","path":"/blog/robonomics-frontier/","date":"July 23, 2021","description":"As a result of the summer Kusama crowdloans, Robonomics reached the Top-10 projects of the Polkadot ecosystem. Before the next wave of auctions, the project’s developers decided to deploy and maintain a functionally identical network.","content":"import Card from '~/components/TextCard.vue'\n\n## Not a wild cousin of Kusama\n\nKusama Relay chain is under development and passes all updates using stable versions of Polkadot releases. For example, the current version of Kusama was built on [polkadot v0.9.8](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.8) release.\n\n![Kusama Relay Chain and Polkadot release 0.9.8](./images/Robonomics-Frontier/Kusama-Relay-Chain-and-Polkadot-release-0-9-8.jpg)\n\nFrontier Relay chain will use the same versions of Polkadot releases, which will be implemented by Kusama network in the form of its Relay chain.\n\nTo connect to Frontier Relay chain, you can use Substrate portal following this link: https://parachain.robonomics.network/ \n\nAfter connecting the Robonomics parachain to the Frontier Relay chain we can have a blockchain that could work in real-time and would be integrated into the Kusama network. It means that we need to overcome any challenges that Kusama parachains will have. All new capabilities that will appear with new Polkadot releases, will be also supported by Robonomics’ parachain.\n\n## XCMP and integration with Kusama parachains\n\nMaybe only one disadvantage today (in 2021), when we are talking about the lifecycle in a Frontier network and not about the main Kusama network, is a lack of integration via [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain#overview-of-xcmp).\n\nBut it does not mean that you cannot execute technical integration tasks and prepare a Robonomics parachain to work with Karura, Moonriver and Khala. It is those three parachains that are interesting for the Robonomics team in terms of integration. We can start maintaining work in a Frontier network with copies of the mentioned projects, but only after release of public documentation and first samples of using Kusama (how to create trading pair on Karura, connect functions of parachain with solidity/ink smart contracts in Moonriver, or to provide data privacy with Khala).\n\nI’m personally expecting that the process of parachains integration would be executed very carefully in the first year, and maybe other projects will also work together in sandboxes and after it transfer integration mechanisms to Kusama network. So, Robonomics could be in the Kusama network right to the moment of active integration between the projects.\n\n## Genesis block of Robonomics parachain in Frontier network\n\nIn the genesis block will be presented XRT balances of exodus participants, crowdloan contributors and open test network collators. This block will be formed only a few days before the parachain launch in a Frontier network. We will announce this update on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AIRA_Robonomics) and [Telegram](https://t.me/Robonomics_ann).\n\nWe are expecting that the genesis block will be formed during the period from 28th to 31st of July.\n\nImportant information for XRT holders in the Ethereum network: To participate in the parachain’s genesis block and participate in staking, you can use dapp exodus till 28th of July. After 28th of July the opportunity to transfer XRT tokens into Ethereum to Frontier will still be available. But this process will be executed by the technical committee of the network and not more often than once a week.\n\nAlso we would like to notice, that the exodus would not allow you to go back till the moment when Robonomics parachain will be connected to the Kusama network, and when there will be suitable bridge to Ethereum. The situation is ~ similar to the process of transfer to Ethereum 2.0 for ETH holders.\n\n## XRT staking\n\nXRT staking in Robonomics parachain aims to split the capacity between two options of payments: for transaction or for subscription. You can read more about this in the article [“RWS overview, part 2 “Heterogeneous tokenomics”](https://blog.aira.life/rws-overview-part-2-heterogeneous-tokenomics-afc209cc855) on Medium.\n\nThe basis of reward for the staking will be ~ 10%. This amount helps to launch the parachain. In the future, the reward will be determined by [Democracy pallet](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/pallet_democracy/) for XRT holders. \n\nCrowdloan contributors will get increased reward rate — 50%. Thus, it will help us to test the mechanism: “Parachain, which always wins”, which will propose adaptive reward for staking Robonomics to the reward for staking in Kusama / Polkadot relay chain and considering XRT price to KSM/DOT. We will explain later in detail about this mechanism and after a few tests. \n\nStaking will be available from the update 1.1 in Frontier network. Please note that tokens transfer in parachain will be turned off on the start, similar to the launch of the Polkadot Relay chain.\n\n## Roadmap - Life after auction\n\nRegardless of that we did not win a slot — the roadmap of parachain development won’t change. Below you will find our plans that were published in the article: https://robonomics.network/blog/crowdloan-starts-today/.\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 1: Establishing core functionality\n\nIn 3 months after the Robonomics parachain launch, Robonomics developers are going to activate the core functionally that’s been developing during 2019-2021, and also supplement the network with modules that have proven themselves in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n* **Genesis state: (0 week)** Launch of the starter pack of Robonomics parachain functions with IoT management services and collators reward systems.\n* **Update 1.1** Staking and allowing transfers (3 - 4 week). Will allow you to transfer XRT and stake your XRT with a 10% APR for all token holders and 50% for Crowdloan participants.\n* **Update 1.2** Treasury and Technical committee (4 - 6 week). Will allow transferring a share of the DAO funds from Ethereum to the parachain. The Technical Committee can produce emergency referenda. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.\n* **Update 1.3** RWS (7 - 8 week). Will allow using IoT management functions with not only commission payments in XRT but a monthly subscription as well.\n* **Update 1.4** Robot-as-a-service (9 - 10 week). Will allow to implement a control process for the provision of automated services and use payments within transactions to launch devices.\n* **Update 1.5** XCMP functionality and Robobank (11 - 12 week). The solution is based on the Polkadot XCMP architecture that will allow any parachain to get access to IoT device management with payment in a native token.\n* **Update 1.6** Democracy and Remove Sudo (13 - 14 week). Developers won’t have the ability to interfere with the operations of the network without the involvement of the technical committee or voting of parachain native token holders.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 2: Launch services based on Robonomics R&D\n\n2nd part of Robonomics parachain growth in Kusama designated to the launch of services based on previous Robonomics team’s R&D projects.\n\n* **Globally available digital passports of products** By supplementing the status of digital twins with information about the produced products, customers will be able to issue digital passports protected against changes and loss of information in the future. This use case is already implemented as a pilot at the enterprise that’s producing drones. The solution used for quality control during packaging with video recording.\n* **Smart leasing of IoT & Robotics** We’ll demonstrate the ability to use the Robonomics parachain for leasing an IoT/Robotics device. Using the example of 2 robots controlled by Robonomics parachain in 2 different industries. The first use case - an educational program based on Boston Dynamics SDK, during which developers will learn how to control the famous robot dog - Spot. The second one - an industrial manipulator sold under a leasing agreement in the United States. Both robots will provide customers with automatically generated reports at the end of the user session.\n* **Environmental mitigation services for smart buildings with real carbon credits** It will allow customers to automatically collect information about the electricity consumption of the household or apartment building, burn carbon credits, and store a report in the parachain.\n* **Fault-tolerant civil sensors network** A complete set of software modules for creating a sensor network in a city or enterprise to track the desired indicators and provide access to them without a central point of failure. Today it is being tested in one of Russian’s industrial cities - Togliatti.\n* **Self-driving cars and drones traffic management solution to avoid route collisions in public areas** It’ll allow managing a fleet of drones with publicly monitored access to route changes to public agencies responsible for local security and efficiency of air space and roads.\n* **Ecosystem integration updates** We will focus on integrations with other parachains to expand the capabilities of IoT projects that are interested in the Polkadot ecosystem’s features.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card>\n\n### Part 3: Transform into Robonomics Relay Chain\n\nThe final task for the 48 weeks of existence in the Kusama network is the transformation of the Robonomics parachain into the Robonomics Relay Chain. This is our vision of the future of Robonomics, as a complete segment of the Polkadot infrastructure specifically prepared for working with IoT devices.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card :image=\"'/avatars/Sergei-Lonshakov.jpg'\" :back=\"'transparent'\" imageSize=\"big\" alignContentV=\"middle\">\n\n#### EnsRationis\n\nRobonomics network architect\n\nelement: @ensrationis:robonomics.network\n\n</Card>\n\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.62c183a.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":675},"sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px","srcset":["/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.9ea8d39.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 480w","/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.6b2ed88.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/Robonomics-Frontier_cover_2_blog.62c183a.88fc438347149cbf4568c60316d26493.jpg 1500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1500 675' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-a8d4627542763c17c6fd0d78e16693ac'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-a8d4627542763c17c6fd0d78e16693ac)' width='1500' height='675' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAdAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAYDBwECBQj/xAAvEAACAQMDAwMBBwUAAAAAAAABAgMEBREAEiEGE0ExUWGBByIjQnGRoRUkMsHw/8QAGQEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwYBBAUC/8QAJhEAAQQCAQMDBQAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxEEEkEFEzEhIlFxgZGSwf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A82RIrKSx/bxqSWBVQlc5X/LPg88enrrFNHLP%2bFHHvxz642/XUtZBLAx3QhFc8ENuH6aYgCTSN236716fPCgp6aWqlMcChmwW5IAwPk6Dk4JzwdWX9i9ugq%2bpgZiso7Tq8fbJ7Y4w5YkAc4AAyT7D10v9cpYBfLpT2qCohminaOLsuJIZcHBwDhl88AtoWQ6hSr7%2b4tpcbpy3R1lS0tQ0Zp4MF0YnLZ/18661bQ2ePYkSQn8I5IZ8glvOfzDPjjGgLH/ZVi0zx1sNzaoVNuAm1fI%2b9yG588aZUjtUsMvbqqxWIMciO8WcbuVPx5/XXcUUboC8AEjyqczX9zYuoLW5dNW6uo6v%2blNRJJG3dWaJpO2yheQN/IXzyM5%2bNV6NP8Vc6Uz0dsNxqqeeYxOg2OXbbxgLySAT8aRZYJYJninjeKVCVZHGGUjwR76rnR7g1go0oxu40uEjrHCerNDTQuQ8YcZBK5xu%2bM6l6laKpSRlhihDYCRxjAUD/vXQIONRTnIydbRYQ7e0/l7BAYtR4I/KaOiesem7NRGhulknpZ3jMTXSgmJm5YMGKMcZBAIx%2b3J1r18nSqTVfUXR/VES1U8iym2vSMG35BJUlcLzlsH09/TVfV3roFE7kyJnG5gP50vZfT6l7kcjhZsiwQf2BI%2bxFcUleSo3GgmGyWG7dYXBqmpnmcSud1TNlzI/sPckkfvqwIPszjt9JIezcWLRhXflRk87hx7Zxrj01eaBUjpY1ijiwFVSR6effPn66xcur6zshArBQRx3nwR7Yzpuw%2bihlegJ5ShPPk5UlMdq3gD%2brWltlV0Rfaa7WpDHOpMcUNfFvjnJADLu4xwQefcc6Teo7hWXi/V9fdF21s8paZcYw3pjH00VdbtPcmUzl/ukkAyMw/kn20NcSJqalnKgScxMR%2bfbggn5wcfQaLL0THgeMljad4P0WnFs2g82flf/2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"locale":"en"}},{"node":{"title":"Trajectory of Robonomics Development 2021, Part 1","path":"/blog/roadmap-2021/","date":"February 18, 2021","description":"The Polkadot architecture is becoming explicit and complete, which should allow us, as parachain developers, to shift our focus from maintaining improvements in Polkadot dependencies (the substrate framework, cumulus and other), and move on to increasing the functionality of our parachain.","content":"\nStarting with this article, I would like to share the tasks that the core project development team are ready to share with the community today.\n\nIn total, we have counted about [20 tasks](https://github.com/orgs/airalab/projects/7) that we are willing to implement this year. Some of them are full-fledged tasks, while the second part rather reflects the fact that the core developers devote time to this area, for example, supporting the academic community, conducting dev camps and developing Internet resources around the project.\n\nToday I will share the development team plans related to task #1 - launching parachain on the Kusama network.\n\n## Task #1: Parachain on Kusama\nLeads: [@ensrationis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0c53yygAAAAJ&hl=en), [@akru](https://github.com/akru)\n\n![\"Robonomics Parachain on Kusama first\"](./images/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/Robonomics_Parachain-web.jpg)\n\nEarlier, we presented a general vision of development in the Polkadot ecosystem - [Robonomics Parachain on Kusama first, Robonomics Relay Chain on Polkadot is a vision](https://robonomics.network/blog/robonomics-parachain-lease-offering/). Now let's add more details.\n\n### Rococo > Kusama > Polkadot \n\nOn December 31, 2020, [the Robonomics release \"Rococo V1 support\"](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/tag/v0.22.0) for testing the parachain in the main Polkadot testnet Rococo v1 was published. During January - February 2021, we continue to improve the Robonomics code merging new commits associated with the restarts of Rococo Relay Chain. To test the operation of the Robonomics parachain, the developers keep our own fork of Rococo Relay Chain up to date, so the issue of connecting our parachain to the public network is rather a question of (1) public proof of the project's compatibility with the ecosystem, (2) the possibility of conducting tests with other projects from the ecosystem - Phala, Acala, Moonbeam, Darwinia etc - to search for collaborative implementations using the now available XCMP in Rococo v1.\n\n### Kusama Slot Auction\n\nAhead of us are tasks related to participation in the auction of slots of the Kusama network. First, we need to figure out the implementation of this mechanism. Of course, we have been studying the theory for a long time, but the practice of participating in the auction will open up new tasks for the team. In any case, we will try to rehearse the auction and share the results with the community through a blog post.\n\n### Democracy, Treasury and others parachains modules\n\nIn addition to participating in the auction, the developers are in the discussion of the following issues regarding the launch of the parachain on the Kusama network:\n\n* What modules from the standard and used in the Polkadot / Kusama network can be useful to developers and the community after the launch of the parachain?\n* How are we going to launch parachain: follow the scenario from root privileges for the main developers to democracy, or …\n* How many XRT tokens should be transferred from Ethereum to Kusama and then to Polkadot?\n* The minimum inflation parameters in the Robonomics network for the successful launch of the staking mechanism at the start of the parachain.\n* …\n\nOf course, there are more questions, but these ones will most likely be interesting for the community in the first place and we think about them as a priority.\n\n### Specific Functions of Robonomics Parachain\n\nWhile speaking about the launch of the parachain, we must understand its main and special functions, which open up new possibilities of the Polkadot network to a certain group of users. Robonomics will provide the ability to manage smart devices connected to the Internet using the Robonomics Web Services (short: RWS) functionality, and we will also implement the functionality already tested on the Ethereum network for the emerging robot economy - smart contracts for the provision of automated services. Thus, Robonomics aims to help the entire Polkadot ecosystem increase the capabilities of each project separately towards deep integration with the IoT market.\n\nTo date, the possibility has already been implemented (1) to enable, disable and transfer the IoT task to the device / robot through the Robonomics parachain; (2) to receive device telemetry directly through the parachain or in a combination of IPFS + parachain for big data, and (3) a parachain subscription mechanism with guaranteed bandwidth.\n\nAhead of us is the implementation of such functionality as:\n \n1. Robobank to accept any Polkadot token in automation services\n2. Single version of True via Digital Twins on Blockchain\n3. Bitcoin payments for real estate\n4. Privacy of using IoT applications\n5. global supply chains on blockchain\n6. DeFi connectivity for IoT\n7. NFT for IoT\n\nAs you can see, tasks such as (3), (4), (6), (7) are of particular interest, since they imply integration with other parachains in order to utilize their useful functions in Robonomics.\n\nLet us see the power of a common ecosystem of many specific projects!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Polkadot architecture is becoming explicit and complete, which should allow us, as parachain developers, to shift our focus from maintaining improvements in Polkadot dependencies (the substrate framework, cumulus and other), and move on to increasing the functionality of our parachain.\n\nIt is important not to forget that the process of racing for a parachain slot is an internal development process, but most importantly - a specific functionality of a parachain; the main thing is to provide Robonomics functions to other parachains and implement the use of other parachains in your code. Then the entire ecosystem will be able to provide interesting functionality to users; functionality that will be extremely difficult to find outside of Polkadot.\n\nIn the next article I will talk about the Robobank project, the improvements of the Substrate based client of the Robonomics Network, as well as our plans for the development of Robonomics dapp and Robonomics Web Services.\n\n*ensrationis*","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/1.62c183a.0b4ff580eb7c82adac28c73dc00bebfe.jpg","size":{"width":1500,"height":676},"sizes":"(max-width:
