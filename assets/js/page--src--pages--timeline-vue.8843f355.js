Our experiments with IoT equipment led us to the concept of a sovereign smart home, one which is independent of centralized cloud service providers.

Robonomics 1.0 on Substrate has been released, and we have been testing connecting sensors to the parachain to send their telemetry data, as well as developing the digital twin functionality. In the middle of the year, we decided to test the full cycle of our network and created our own relay chain called <a class='timeline__link' href='/blog/robonomics-frontier/' target='_blank'>Robonomics Frontier</a>, to which the Robonomics parachain was integrated (prior to being migrated to the Kusama relay chain). There has been a lot of focus on getting a parachain slot in Kusama, for which we organized several crowdloan campaigns.</p><p class='timeline__descr'>There have been two big changes for the community. First, we launched the <a class='timeline__link' href='https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-program' target='_blank'>Robonomics Grant Program</a>, which allows web3 robotics and IoT projects to receive funding for R&D tasks. By the end of the year, four active projects participated in the program. Secondly, the team started the <a class='timeline__link' href='https://youtu.be/4Np5-95LdvY' target='_blank'>Exodus process</a>, allowing Ethereum token holders to move their XRT tokens to the parachain.</p><p class='timeline__descr'>Among the collaborations, we can recall the remarkable appearance of Boston Dynamics Spot at MerkleBot, for which a <a class='timeline__link' href='https://spot.merklebot.com/' target='_blank'>rental remote control system</a> was developed. We would also like to inform you about the Multi-Agent Systems company which is a personal project that has been formed by a team of Robonomics engineers.

The upgrade to ETH2.0 was supposed to fix the situation, but this upgrade was repeatedly delayed. Whilst we did not want to leave the Ethereum network, we realized that in the current situation it was difficult to implement our use cases, and we began to look for an alternative network. The sharded blockchain ecosystem Polkadot became this alternative. We started by experimenting with the Substrate framework to migrate the main Robonomics features and to deploy our own testnet. By the end of this stage, we had deployed our parachain on the Rococo testnet and started preparing to get a slot on the Kusama network.</p><p class='timeline__descr'>Continuing to study IoT systems, we have identified the main functionality of Robonomics, which can add value to users — the function of decentralized cloud for IoT. This idea formed the basis of <a class='timeline__link' href='https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-web-services-and-rws-token-intro-d730ab50ad42' target='_blank'>Robonomics Web Services</a>. The RWS infrastructure took on all the functions of a typical centralized cloud, but without the standard problems of global availability, security and privacy. Additionally, we came up with the idea of parachain IoT subscriptions that allows subscription holders to use the blockchain network without having to pay a fee for each transaction. The first experiment with IoT subscriptions was the emission of the RWS token, which allows its owner to send 1 transaction per block. In addition, we began to take the first steps to develop our own hardware kit for control of smart devices (the DAOS concept).</p><p class='timeline__descr'>Of course, support for Robonomics on Ethereum has not stopped. The Robonomics communication stack has been finalized to version <a class='timeline__link' href='https://github.com/airalab/robonomics_comm/releases/tag/v1.0.0' target='_blank'> LTS 1.0.</a>. The XRT token has started trading on several exchanges (in particular, the Uniswap DEX), and the liquidity incentivization program was launched.</p><p class='timeline__descr'>The team actively developed ways to interact with the community. The first version of our <a class='timeline__link' href='https://blog.aira.life/the-robonomics-dapp-overview-acb003f51b9a' target='_blank'>dapp</a> site and Robonomics Wiki have been launched. For more transparent and convenient project management, we started using <a class='timeline__link' href='https://client.aragon.org/#/aira/' target='_blank'>Aragon DAO</a>. We hosted <a class='timeline__link' href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkys45xOYDp0qEsCerAXdw9cofJZW3Fie' target='_blank'>Robonomics Winter School</a> in 2019 for newcomers to the project.</p><p class='timeline__descr'>Collaborations with congenial projects also continued. Robonomics and DAO IPCI introduced a service for collecting and analyzing sensory data — <a class='timeline__link' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shqey3tmNUk' target='_blank'> RoSeMAN</a>. Robonomics became the foundation for the <a class='timeline__link' href='https://merklebot.com/' target='_blank'>MerkleBot</a> project, which is developing a system for smart leasing of robotic equipment.</p>",line:!0},{id:3,year:"2017 - 2018",title:"The Rise of Robonomics Network",text:"<p class='timeline__descr'>We understood that autonomous agents needed an environment that would ensure their reliable technical and economic operations. For several years we had been developing a protocol for creating a decentralized network of providers that help robotic agents provide their services. Tools for network maintenance and for the communication stack between Ethereum and ROS have been developed. In 2018 we published the <a class='timeline__link' href='https://static.robonomics.network/docs/whitepaper/Robonomics-whitepaper-en.pdf' target='_blank'>Robonomics Whitepaper</a> and the alpha version of Robonomics Network was launched on the Ethereum mainnet.
