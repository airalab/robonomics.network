Typically, these suggestions are not followed by any well-thought-out marketing steps, but the message is clear. If you invest more in advertising activities, everything will be wonderful and your token will go to the moon. In this blog post, I will try to analyze this situation, evaluate Robonomics' annual activity and compare it with similar projects.
