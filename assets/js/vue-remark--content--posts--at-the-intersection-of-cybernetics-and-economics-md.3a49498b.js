The creators of Robonomics presented various concepts and solutions, united around the idea of the robot economy in scientific research and articles. The essence of the idea is in the economic system in which robotic devices act as independent agents capable of performing key economic activities, previously reserved for humans. If the M2M (machine-to-machine) structure is set up correctly, then the robot economy can become an extension of the human economy, improving and accelerating its processes. However, the organization of the M2M structure presents various difficulties.
